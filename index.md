**BigBlueButton** is an open source web conferencing system for online learning. Cool!

We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton.

We've written this documentation for administrators and developers who want to install, customize, and enhance BigBlueButton. If you are an end-user (instructor or teacher) interested in learning more about BigBlueButton (and how it works) visit [bigbluebutton.org](http://bigbluebutton.org). 

The source code for BigBlueButton is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).

## Getting started

BigBlueButton enables real-time sharing of audio, video, presentation (with whiteboard markup), polling, emote icons (including raise hand), chat, and the presenter's desktop.  It is [localized](/dev/localization.html) into over 35 languages and supports JAWS screen reader. 

There are two types of users in a BigBlueButton session: _viewer_ or _moderator_.  A viewer (typically the student) can chat, display an emote icon, and send/receive audio and video.  A moderator (typically the instructor) can, in addition to all the capabilities of a viewer, mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers, or make anyone (including themselves) the presenter.  The current presenter can can upload slides, annotate them (using the whiteboard controls), and share his or her desktop for all to see.


If you are new to BigBlueButton we recommend (in order): 

  1. Watch the [overview videos](http://bigbluebutton.org/videos) to better understand the capabilities of viewer, moderator, and presenter.
  1. Try out BigBlueButton using our [Demo Server](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/). 
  1. Join the BigBlueButton community 
     * [bigbluebutton-setup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-setup) – Get help with installation, setup and configuration of a BigBlueButton server.
     * [bigbluebutton-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-users) – Get help and give us feedback on using BigBlueButton.
     * [bigbluebutton-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev) – Ask questions and share experiences with other BigBlueButton developers.  
  1. Follow announcements on social media via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bigbluebutton), [FaceBook](https://www.facebook.com/bigbluebutton), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bigbluebuttonshare), or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+bigbluebutton).  
      
Next, depending on whether you are a developer or administrator, we recommend:

  1. [Install](/install/install.html) BigBlueButton your own server (Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit).
  1. Read the [FAQ](/support/faq.html).
  1. Use an existing [integration](http://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-integrations/) as a front-end or, if you're a developer, use the [BigBlueButton API](/dev/api.html) to integrate BigBlueButton with your sofware or createa custom front-end.
  1. [Setup](/install/setup.html) a development environment to modify and extend BigBlueButton for your needs.

Want to give feedback?  Join one of the above mailing lists and share your thoughts.  

The BigBlueButton project began in 2008 (see [history](http://bigbluebutton.org/history/)). The project is managed by a core group of [commiters](/support/faq.html#bigbluebutton-committer).that are _very_ determined to see this project meet is goals.  If you like BigBlueButton, you can give back by spreading the word (blog, tweet, upload a video to YouTube, etc.) about the project.  You'll find the project is a global community that believes the entrepreneurial opportunities and social benefits of providing remote students a high-quality on-line learning experience.


## Latest versions

The latest version of BigBlueButton is 1.0. See [overview](/overview/overview.html), [install](/install/install.html), and [architecture](/overview/architecture.html) for more details.
