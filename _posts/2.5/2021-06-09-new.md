# Overview

BigBlueButton 2.5 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

- **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier
- **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
- **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.5.

## Usability

### Screenshot of current slide with annotations

To capture the current slide with annotations, you can now have BigBlueButton give you a PNG image of the current slide.

<br /><br />


### Easier setup of breakout rooms

Breakout rooms remember your previous rooms assignments within the current session.  This lets you re-use the existing breakout rooms.

### Change time of breakout rooms

You can now easily change the duration of a breakout rooms to a new time.

<br /><br />

When you change the duration of breakout rooms, BigBlueButton will notify each breakout room in the public chat of the new duration.

<br /><br />

### Webcam pinning

You can now pin a webcam so it always stays visible.  This is useful if one on of the webcams is showing sign language, for example, and you always want it to be visible.

<br /><br />

### Improvements to Guest Lobby

Private guest lobby message, display position in waiting line

### Improvements to Endpoint API 

#### New endpoint

A new API endpoint was added: `/insertDocument`. Now, it is possible to send a batch of documents with all the common presentation parameters such as `current`, `downloadable` and `removable`. 

All the presentations are sent via payload (the body of the request) such as when preuploading documents in `/create` endpoint, whether by a link to download the file or by `base64` encoded file. See the [API documentation](/dev/api.html#insertdocument) for more information

## Engagement

### Text message broadcasting to breakout rooms

You can now broadcast a text message to all breakout rooms.  This message will appear in the public chat of each breakout room.

<br /><br />

### Polling support for multiple answers per question

## Analytics

### Learning Analytics Dashboard improvements

Newly introduced Timeline with slide thumbnails and improved display of user emoji timing.

## Performance

### Improved scaling of webcams and screenshare

BigBlueButton now uses [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) (instead of Kurento) as its default WebRTC media server.  You'll find mediasoup able to handle more media streams (including screenshare) using less memory and CPU.

For analysis on mediasoup vs. Kurento, see [BigBlueButton World - BigBlueButton's Media Stack and the Road Ahead](https://youtu.be/SBO5iWLs0KE). Note that Kurento is still installed on the system and still plays a role in the recording of media.


## Experimental

### Two-way microphone connections using Mediasoup

FreeSWITCH is awesome, but it doesn't support dual-stack IPV4 and IPV6 (we bridge this with nginx).  It does not support trickle ICE for quick connections.

The experimental microphone bridge introduced in 2.4 is moving towards feature complete in 2.5.  Support for the following features are now in 2.5:
  - mediasoup now proxies audio connections for FreeSWITCH
  - Echo test
  - Input and output device switching
  - Audio filters

For a list of pending issues for the experimental audio bridge to be considered production-grade, check this [Depends on](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/14021#fullaudio-depends-on) section in GitHub.

Moreover, the steps for enabling this have changed slightly since 2.4. If you want to try this (keep in mind it is still experimental), you need to add the `fullAudioEnabled: true` flag in bbb-webrtc-sfu's configuration (`/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/production.yml`).  

```
mkdir -p /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu
if ! grep -q "fullAudioEnabled: true" /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/production.yml; then echo "fullAudioEnabled: true" >> /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/production.yml; fi
```


Once that flag is enabled in bbb-webrtc-sfu, there are two ways of opting in:

1. Using API parameters you can have specific meetings use the experimental bridge by passing: CREATE parameter `meta_fullaudio-bridge=fullaudio` to override the default `sipjs` value

2. You can change the defaults in the settings for bbb-html5 by adding the following to `/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-html5.yml` (you will likely want to merge it carefully with your existing file):

  ```
  public:
    media:
      audio:
        defaultFullAudioBridge: fullaudio
  ```

After a restart of BigBlueButton (`sudo bbb-conf --restart`), it should be ready to test. Reverting to the default options can be achieved by removing the override sections (and passed API parameters) and restart of BigBlueButton.

## Upgraded components

# Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.5 needs similar [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.5/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.4.

To install 2.5, use [bbb-install-2.5.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/blob/master/bbb-install-2.5.sh). For example, the following command installs BigBlueButton 2.5 using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address). Notice the version is `-v focal-250`, which will install the latest officially published release (alpha/beta/etc) of BigBlueButton 2.5. If you instead use `-v focal-25-dev`, you will be installing/updating to the very latest build tracking the source code from branch `v2.5.x-release`.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install-2.5.sh | bash -s -- -v focal-250 -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.5 with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos. With the API demos installed, you can open `https://<hostname>/` in a browser (where `<hostname>` is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install-2.5.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'. For more information, see the [bbb-install-2.5.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/blob/master/bbb-install-2.5.sh) documentation.
