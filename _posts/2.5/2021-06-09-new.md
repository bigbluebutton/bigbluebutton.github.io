# Overview

This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.5.

*Note:* This document is DRAFT and will be expanded upon as 2.5 development goes through alpha, beta, and release.

## What's new

BigBlueButton 2.5 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

- **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier
- **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
- **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.5

- **Usability**

### Screenshot of current slide with annotations

### Easier setup of breakout rooms

Breakout rooms remember previous rooms assignments and can automatically populate the rooms

### Improved experience when changing the duration of breakout rooms after their creation

Support for both extending and reducing the duration, notification in the main room and in each breakout room

### Whiteboard improvements

Fill shape

<!-- Erase, -->
 <!-- Redo, ... -->

### Webcam pinning

### Improvements to Guest Lobby

Private guest lobby message, display of waiting time, moving users back to the lobby, display position in waiting line

- **Engagement**

### Text message broadcasting to breakout rooms

### Randomly select user without repetitions

### Learning Analytics Dashboard improvements

Newly introduced Timeline with slide thumbnails and improved display of user emoji timing

- **Administration**

### All package scripts are included in the source code repository

### Polling support for multiple answers per question

- **Performance**

### Improved scaling of webcams and screenshare

We have switched to a different media server - [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) (instead of Kurento) for handling WebRTC video streams (webcams and screenshare) and listen only.
For analysis on mediasoup vs. Kurento, see [BigBlueButton World - BigBlueButton's Media Stack and the Road Ahead](https://youtu.be/SBO5iWLs0KE). Note that Kurento is still installed on the system and still plays a role in the recording of media.

Under the hood, BigBlueButton 2.5 installs on Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit, and the following key components have been updated

- Tomcat 9
- Java 11
- Meteor 2.5
- SBT 1.6.2
- Grails 5.0.1
- Gradle 7.3.1
- Note that BigBlueButton 2.5 is the first iteration running on Ubuntu 20.04

# Features

The following sections give details of the new features.

## Usability

## Engagement

## Experimental

**_Note_** These features below are experimental and incomplete and should _not_ be used for a production server. They are primarily included for developers testing new capabilities that may appear in subsequent releases to 2.5.

### Experimental microphone bridge updates

The experimental microphone bridge introduced in 2.4 is feature complete in 2.5. Support for the following features has been added:
  - mediasoup
  - Echo test
  - Input and output device switching
  - Audio filters

For a list of pending issues for the experimental audio bridge to be considered production-grade, check this [Depends on](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/14021#fullaudio-depends-on) section in GitHub.

Moreover, the steps for enabling this have changed slightly since 2.4. If you want to try this (keep in mind it is still experimental), you need to add the `fullAudioEnabled: true` flag in bbb-webrtc-sfu's configuration (/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-webrtc-sfu/production.yml).

Once that flag is enabled in bbb-webrtc-sfu, there are two ways of opting in:
1. Using API parameters you can have specific meetings use the experimental bridge by passing: CREATE parameter `meta_fullaudio-bridge=fullaudio` to override the default `sipjs` value
2. You can change the defaults in the settings for bbb-html5 by adding the following to `/etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-html5.yml` (you will likely want to merge it carefully with your existing file):
  ```
  public:
    media:
      audio:
        defaultFullAudioBridge: fullaudio
  ```

After a restart of BigBlueButton (`sudo bbb-conf --restart`), it should be ready to test. Reverting to the default options can be achieved by removing the override sections (and passed API parameters) and restart of BigBlueButton.

## Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.5 needs similar [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.5/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.4.

To install 2.5, use [bbb-install-2.5.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/blob/master/bbb-install-2.5.sh). For example, the following command installs BigBlueButton 2.5-dev using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address). Notice the version is `-v focal-250`, which will install the latest officially published release (alpha/beta/etc) of BigBlueButton 2.5. If you instead use `-v focal-25-dev`, you will be installing/updating to the very latest build tracking the source code from branch `v2.5.x-release`.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install-2.5.sh | bash -s -- -v focal-250 -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-

```

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.5-dev with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos. With the API demos installed, you can open https://<hostname>/ in a browser (where <hostname> is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install-2.5.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'. For more information, see the [bbb-install-2.5.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/blob/master/bbb-install-2.5.sh) documentation.

BigBlueButton 2.5-dev is under active development. While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on [our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).
