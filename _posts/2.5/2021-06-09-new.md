# Overview

This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.5.

*Note:* This document is DRAFT and will be expanded upon as 2.5 development goes through alpha, beta, and release.

## What's new

BigBlueButton 2.5 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

- **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier
- **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
- **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.5

- **Usability**

### Screenshot of slide with annotations

### Easier setup of breakout rooms

Breakout rooms remember previous rooms assignments and can automatically populate the rooms

### Improved experience when breakout rooms are closed early

BigBlueButton provides a notification to all rooms and (default of) 30 seconds notice before the actual room closing.

### Whiteboard improvements

Fill shape

<!-- Erase, -->
 <!-- Redo, ... -->

### Webcam pinning

### Improvements to Guest Lobby

Private guest lobby message, display of waiting time, moving users back to the lobby, display position in waiting line

- **Engagement**

### Text message broadcasting to breakout rooms

### Randomly select user without repetitions

### Learning Analytics Dashboard improvements

Newly introduced Timeline with slide thumbnails and improved display of user emoji timing

- **Administration**

### All package scripts are included in the source code repository

### Polling support for multiple answers per question

- **Performance**

<!-- ### Improved scaling of audio -->

### Improved scaling of webcams and screenshare

We have switched to a different media server - [mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/) (instead of Kurento) for handling WebRTC video streams (webcams and screenshare) and listen only.
For analysis on mediasoup vs. Kurento, see [BigBlueButton World - BigBlueButton's Media Stack and the Road Ahead](https://youtu.be/SBO5iWLs0KE). Note that Kurento is still installed on the system and still plays a role in the recording of media.

Under the hood, BigBlueButton 2.5 installs on Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit, and the following key components have been updated

- Java 11
- Meteor 2.5

For full details on what is new in BigBlueButton 2.5, see the release notes. Recent releases:

# Features

The following sections give details of the new features.

## Usability

## Engagement

## Installation

For server requirements, BigBlueButton 2.5 needs similar [minimum server requirements](https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/2.5/install.html#minimum-server-requirements) as 2.4.

To install 2.5, use [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install). For example, the following command installs BigBlueButton 2.5-dev using `bbb.example.com` as the hostname and `notice@example.com` as the email for Let's Encrypt (you would substitute these values for your own hostname and email address). Notice the version is `-v bionic-250`, which will install the latest officially published release (alpha/beta/etc) of BigBlueButton 2.5. If you instead use `-v bionic-25-dev`, you will be installing/updating to the very latest build tracking the source code from branch `v2.5.x-release`.

```bash
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install.sh | bash -s -- -v bionic-250 -s bbb.example.com -e notice@example.com  -a -w
```

After installation finishes, you should see the following installed packages (your version numbers may be slightly different).

```bash
# dpkg -l | grep bbb-

```

This installs the latest version of BigBlueButton 2.5-dev with Let's encrypt certificate and the API demos. With the API demos installed, you can open https://<hostname>/ in a browser (where <hostname> is the hostname you specified in the `bbb-install.sh` command), enter your name, and click 'Join' to join 'Demo Meeting'. For more information, see the [bbb-install.sh](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install) documentation.

BigBlueButton 2.5-dev is under active development. While we don't recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on [our bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).
