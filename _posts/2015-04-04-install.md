Welcome to the installation guide for BigBlueButton version 0.9.0.  BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  For an overview what new in this release, see [overview](/overview/090overview.html).

We recommend you install BigBlueButton 0.9.0 on a dedicated Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit server that is not running any other web applications.  This will avoid subtle conflicts (such as with underlying configuration files) that will cause errors in BigBlueButton installation and running.

If you already have a BigBlueButton 0.81 server running Ubuntu 10.04, we recommend **not** trying to upgrade your server.  Start with a clean Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit server, install BigBlueButton using the steps below, and then [copy over the recordings](#reprocess-recordings-from-0.81) from the old BigBlueButton server to the new.


# Before you install

The prerequisites for BigBlueButton 0.9.0 server are

  * Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit server 
  * 4 GB of memory with swap enabled (8 GB is better) 
  * Quad-core 2.6 GHZ CPU (or faster)
  * TCP ports 80, 1935, 9123 are accessible
  * UDP ports 16384 - 32768 are accessible
  * Port 80 is **not** in use by another application
  * 500G of free disk space (or more) for recordings
  * 100 Mbits/sec bandwidth (symmetrical)
  * Dedicated (bare metal) hardware (not virtualization)

If you intend to setup BigBlueButton for development, then installation in a virtualized environment works well. For development, you probably don't need a VM witih 500G of free disk space; 50G would be sufficent.  However, if you intend to run BigBlueButton in prouduction, we recommend installation on a dedicated (bare metal) server.  BigBlueButton uses FreeSWITCH for processing the incoming real-time packets for audio, and FreeSWITCH works best in a non-virtualized environment (see [FreeSWITCH recommended configurations](https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/Performance+Testing+and+Configurations#PerformanceTestingandConfigurations-RecommendedConfigurations)).

For users we recommend (a minimum of) 1.0 Mbits/sec download speed and 0.5 Mbits/sec upload speed.

In addition to ensuring your server meets the above requirements, there are a few more checks.  First, the locale of the server must be en\_US.UTF-8.  To verify , enter the following command

```
$ cat /etc/default/locale
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
```

If you don't see `LANG="en_US.UTF-8"`, then enter the following commands.

```
$ sudo apt-get install language-pack-en
$ sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

and logout and log back into your SSH session (this will reload your configuration).  Run `cat /etc/default/locale` again and verify you see only the single line `LANG="en_US.UTF-8"`.  Note: if you see an additional line `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`, then remove the setting for `LC_ALL` before continuing.

Check that your server is running 64-bit.

```
$ uname -m
x86_64
```

Check your version of Ubuntu is Ubuntu 14.04.  

```
$ cat /etc/lsb-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 14.04.X LTS"
```
We have designed, developed, installed, and tested BigBlueButton 0.9.0 on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit (Trusty Tahr).  In other words, we have neither installed nor tested testedBigBlueButton on a different release of Ubuntu (and it will likely not work).


# Installing BigBlueButton 0.9.0

If you have already installed an earlier build of 0.9.0 then see [upgrading BigBlueButton 0.9.0](#upgrading-bigbluebutton-0.9.0)

A few words about the installation steps below.  You must completely finish each step before proceeding to the next.  If you encounter an error at any step, STOP and double-check you've entered the proper commands, and don't continue onto the next step as you'll only compound the errors.  If you can't resolve the error (use Google to search for the error messages), then post a description of the error to the [bigbluebutton setup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-setup) mailing list and the community will help.  

[Commercial support](http://bigbluebutton.org/support) is also available.


## 1. Update your server

Loging to your server via SSH.  You need to have an account that can execute commands as root (via sudo). First, ensure that you have `trusty multiverse` in your `sources.list`.  Do the following.

```
$ grep "multiverse" /etc/apt/sources.list
```

and you should see an uncommented line for the multiverse repository, which may look like

```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty multiverse
```

or

```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe multiverse
```

Don't worry if your URL is different, what's important is you see an uncommented link that contains multiverse.  If you don't, then execute the following line to add the multiverse repository to your `sources.list` file.

```
$ echo "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Before proceeding further, do a dist-upgrade to ensure all the current packages on your server are up-to-date.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

If you've not updated in a while, apt-get may recommend you reboot your server after `dist-upgrade` finishes.  Do the reboot before proceeding to the next step.

If you are installing BigBlueButton on EC2 (good for testing, but or production we recommend physical server for better performance), Amazon EC2 provides an external and internal IP address.  After you install BigBlueButton, complete the steps outlined [here](#audio-not-working).

## 2. Install PPA for LibreOffice 4.3

Ubuntu 14.04 installs LibreOffice 4.2.7 by default, but we want to use LibreOffice 4.3 for improved stability on conversion of Microsoft Office documents to PDF.

To add the repository for LibreOffice 4.3, enter the following commands:

```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-4-3
```

## 3. Install key for BigBlueButton

You need to give your server access to the BigBlueButton package repository.  First, add the BigBlueButton key

```
$ wget http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bigbluebutton.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
```
Next, add the BigBlueButton repository URL.

```
$ echo "deb http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/trusty-090/ bigbluebutton-trusty main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
```

Finally, update the package list.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
```

## 4.  Install ffmpeg
BigBlueButton 0.9.0 uses ffmpeg to create componetns of the playback files (the audio, video, and desktop sharing components).

To install ffmpeg, create a file called `install-ffmpeg.sh` and copy-and-paste in the following script.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core checkinstall yasm texi2html libvorbis-dev libx11-dev libvpx-dev libxfixes-dev zlib1g-dev pkg-config netcat libncurses5-dev

FFMPEG_VERSION=2.3.3

cd /usr/local/src
if [ ! -d "/usr/local/src/ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}" ]; then
  sudo wget "http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}.tar.bz2"
  sudo tar -xjf "ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}.tar.bz2"
fi

cd "ffmpeg-${FFMPEG_VERSION}"
sudo ./configure --enable-version3 --enable-postproc --enable-libvorbis --enable-libvpx
sudo make
sudo checkinstall --pkgname=ffmpeg --pkgversion="5:${FFMPEG_VERSION}" --backup=no --deldoc=yes --default
```

Next, make the script executable and run it.

```
$ chmod +x install-ffmpeg.sh
$ ./install-ffmpeg.sh
```

After the script finishes, check that ffmpeg is installed by typing the command `ffmpeg -version`.  You should see the following

```
$ ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg version 2.3.3 Copyright (c) 2000-2014 the FFmpeg developers
  built on Aug 18 2014 17:35:05 with gcc 4.8 (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1)

  libswresample   0. 19.100 /  0. 19.100
```


## 5.  Install BigBlueButton
We're now ready to install BigBlueButton 0.9.0. Type

```
$ sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
```

This single command is where all the magic happens.  This command installs **all** of BigBlueButton's components with their dependencies.

![Install](/images/installpackages.png)

Type 'Y' and press enter to install.  If you get an error message

```
...... Error: FreeSWITCH didn't start 
```

you can ignore it as you'll do a clean restart of all the BigBlueButton components in step 9.


## 6. Install API Demos

This step is optional.

If you want to interactively test your BigBlueButton server (as opposed to using an [3rd party integration](http://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-integrations/)), you can install a set of API demos.

```
$ sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
```

You'll need the bbb-demo package installed if you want to join the Demo Meeting from your BigBlueButton server's welcome page.  This is the same welcome page you see at [demo server](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org).

Later on, if you wish to remove the API demos, you can enter the command

```
$ sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
```

## 7. Install Client Self-Check

This step is optional

BigBlueButton has a self-check utility that can help diagnose networking and configuration issues that may prevent a user from launching BigBlueButton.  To install the client self-check page:

```
$ sudo apt-get install bbb-check
```

This is the same welcome page you see at [client self-check](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/check).

Later on, if you wish to remove the client self-check page, you can enter the command

```
$ sudo apt-get purge bbb-check
```

## 8. Enable WebRTC audio

To enable WebRTC audio (you want to do this), do the following

```
$ sudo bbb-conf --enablewebrtc
```

## 9. Do a Clean Restart

To ensure BigBlueButton has started cleanly, enter the following commands:

```
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
$ sudo bbb-conf --check
```

The `--clean` option will clear out all the log files for BigBlueButton.  The `--check` option will grep through the log files looking for errors.

The output from `sudo bbb-conf --check` will display your current settings and, after the text, " Potential problems described below ", print any potential configuration or startup problems it has detected.

Here's a sample output from a new install on a server with IP address 192.168.0.100.

```
$ sudo bbb-conf --check

#    http://192.168.0.100/
#
# These API demos allow anyone to access your server without authentication
# to create/manage meetings and recordings. They are for testing purposes only.
# If you are running a production system, remove them by running:
#
#    sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo

```
Here the potential problem is just a warning -- you currently have the API demos installed, which would enable anyone with access to the server to launch sessions.

At this point, you could try out your server by opening `http://192.168.0.100` with your web browser (FireFox or Chrome recommended as they support WebRTC audio).

If BigBlueButton didn't install or run, see [troubleshooting installation](#troubleshooting-installation).


# Upgrading BigBlueButton 0.9.0

If already have a BigBlueButton 0.81 server, these instructions will **not** upgrade your server.  To install BigBlueButton 0.9.0, you need to install on a clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit and follow the steps previous in this document.

To upgrade your BigBlueButton 0.9.0 server, add the package repository for LibreOffice 4.3 (if you've not already done this).  To check if you have libreoffice 4.3, enter the command `dpkg -l | grep libreoffice` and you should see a version 4.3.X of libreoffice.

```
$ dpkg -l | grep libreoffice

ii  libreoffice  1:4.3.6~rc2-0ubuntu1~trusty1  amd64  office productivity suite (metapackage)
...
```

If you see

```
ii  libreoffice  1:4.2.7-0ubuntu2   amd64        office productivity suite (metapackage)
...

```

then enter the following commands to upgrade to LibreOffice 4.3 (you need only do these commands once).

```
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-4-3
```

To upgrade an earlier version of BigBlueButton 0.9.0 to the last release, do the following:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

$ sudo bbb-conf --enablewebrtc
$ sudo bbb-conf --clean
$ sudo bbb-conf --check
```

Respond with 'Y', if you get prompted to update any configuration file during the upgrade


# Troubleshooting Installation

The following will help you resolve common errors with installation.

## Run sudo bbb-conf --check
We've built in a BigBlueButton configuration utility, called `bbb-conf`, to help you configure your BigBlueButton server and troubleshoot your setup if something doesn't work right.

If you think something isn't working correctly, the first step is enter the following command.

```
$ sudo bbb-conf --check
```

This will check your setup to ensure the correct processes are running, the BigBlueButton components have correctly started, and look for common configuration problems that might prevent BigBlueButton from working properly.

If you see text after the line `** Potential problems described below **`, then it may be warnings (which you can ignore if you've change settings) or errors with the setup.


## Tomcat7 takes a long time to startup

Tomcat relies on the SecureRandom class (which uses available entropy) to provide random values for its session IDs.  On a virtualized server, however, the available entropy can run low and cause tomcat7 to block for a long period before it finishes it's startup sequence (see [Tomcat's Entropy Source](http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp#Entropy_Source)).

To provide tomcat7 with more entropy, you can install havaged

```
$ sudo apt-get install haveged
```

For more information see [How to Setup Additional Entropy for Cloud Servers Using Haveged](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-additional-entropy-for-cloud-servers-using-haveged).


## Errors with packages

Some hosting providers do not provide a complete `/etc/apt/source.list`.  If you are finding your are unable to install a package, try replacing your `/etc/apt/sources.list` with the following


```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-updates main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty-security main restricted universe multiverse

```

then do

```
$ sudo apt-get update
```

and try installing BigBlueButton again from the beginning.


## BigBlueButton does not load

If your server has multiple network connections, the install scripts may have used the wrong IP for BigBlueButton's configuration.  Another possibility is you want to access BigBlueButton through a hostname (but not IP).  

To change all of BigBlueButton's configuration files to use a different IP address or hostname, enter

```
$ sudo bbb-conf --setip <ip_address_or_hostname>
```

For example

```
$ sudo bbb-conf --setip my.host.com
```


For more information see [bbb-conf options](/install/bbb-conf.html).

## Host IP address has changed

See [BigBlueButton does not load](#bigbluebutton-does-not-load)


## Audio not working

If you are installing BigBlueButton on EC2 or a hosting provider that has a number of network interfaces, you need to tell FreeSWITCH to listen on your external interface on it's IP address (shown below as EXTERNAL\_IP\_ADDRESS).  You must use the external IP address where EXTERNAL\_IP\_ADDRESS is show (not the external hostname).

Edit `/opt/freeswitch/conf/vars.xml`

Remove this line

```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="local_ip_v4=xxx.yyy.zzz.qqq"/>
```

Change

```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="bind_server_ip=auto"/>
```

To

```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="bind_server_ip=EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"/>
```

Change

```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_rtp_ip=stun:stun.freeswitch.org"/>
```

To

```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_rtp_ip=EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"/>
```

Change
```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_sip_ip=stun:stun.freeswitch.org"/>
```

To

```
<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_sip_ip=EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS"/>
```


Edit `/opt/freeswitch/conf/sip_profiles/external.xml` and change

```
    <param name="rtp-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
    <param name="sip-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
    <param name="ext-rtp-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
    <param name="ext-sip-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
```

to

```
    <param name="rtp-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
    <param name="sip-ip" value="$${local_ip_v4}"/>
    <param name="ext-rtp-ip" value="$${external_rtp_ip}"/>
    <param name="ext-sip-ip" value="$${external_sip_ip}"/>
```

Edit `/usr/share/red5/webapps/sip/WEB-INF/bigbluebutton-sip.properties`

```
bbb.sip.app.ip=<internal ip>
bbb.sip.app.port=5070

freeswitch.ip=<internal ip>
freeswitch.port=5060
```

Edit `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/sip.nginx` to

```
location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS:5066;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_read_timeout 6h;
        proxy_send_timeout 6h;
        client_body_timeout 6h;
        send_timeout 6h;
}
```

changing `EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS` to your server's elastic IP address.

Open the following TCP and UPD ports on the local firewall (if you have one installed) and security groups (if your using EC2):

  * TCP - 5066
  * UDP - 16384 to 32768

## Conference not found errors

The command `sudo bbb-conf --debug` searches through the red5, tomcat7, and nginx logs looking for errors and exceptions.  However, the messages such as 

```
    -- ERRORS found in /usr/share/red5/log/* --
/usr/share/red5/log/bigbluebutton.log:2015-05-02 13:50:37,681-04:00 [pool-17-thread-1] ERROR o.b.w.v.f.a.PopulateRoomCommand - Not XML: [Conference 78505 not found]
```

are innocious and can be ignored.


## No Symbolic Link

If you've installed/uninstalled BigBlueButton packages, you may get a `No Symbolic Link` warning from `bbb-conf --check`:

```
** Potential Problems **
    nginx (conf): no symbolic link in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled for bigbluebutton
```

To solve this,  add a symbolic link to nginx for the BigBlueButton site:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bigbluebutton
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

## Voice Application failed to register with sip server
When doing `sudo bbb-conf --check`, you may see the warning

```
voice Application failed to register with sip server
```

This error occurs when `bbb-apps-sip` isn't able to make a SIP call to FreeSWITCH.  You'll see this in BigBlueButton when users click the headset icon and don't join the voice conference.

One possible cause for this is you have just installed BigBlueButton, but not restarted it.  The packages do not start up the BigBlueButton components in the right order.  To restart BigBlueButton, do the following:

```
    sudo bbb-conf --restart
    sudo bbb-conf --check
```

If you don't want FreeSWITCH to bind to 127.0.0.1, you need to figure out which IP address it's using.  First, determine the IP address FreeSWITCH is monitoring for incoming SIP calls with the following command:

```
netstat -ant | grep 5060
```

You should see an output such as

```
tcp        0      0 234.147.116.3:5060    0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
```

In this example, FreeSWITCH is listening on IP address 234.147.116.3.  The IP address on your server will be different.

Next, edit `/usr/share/red5/webapps/sip/WEB-INF/bigbluebutton-sip.properties` and set the value for `sip.server.host` to the IP address returned from the above command.   Save the changes (you'll need to edit the file as root to save changes).

Restart BigBlueButton using the commands and run the built-in diagnostics checks.

```
sudo bbb-conf --clean
sudo bbb-conf --check
```

If the above does not resolve your problem, post to the output of the commands `sudo bbb-conf --check` and `ifconfig` to [bigbluebutton-setup](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-setup/topics?gvc=2) and we'll help you there.
`

## Client WebRTC Error Codes

WebRTC offers very high-quality audio.  However, the user's network settings (or firewall) may not allow WebRTC to connect (or keep connected).

Here are the following lists the possible WebRTC error messages that a user may encounter:

  * **1001: WebSocket disconnected** - The WebSocket had connected successfully and has now disconnected.  Possible Causes:
    * Loss of internet connection
    * Nginx restarting can cause this
  * **1002: Could not make a WebSocket connection** - The initial WebSocket connection was unsuccessful.  Possible Causes:
    * Firewall blocking ws protocol
    * Server is down or improperly configured
  * **1003: Browser version not supported** - Browser doesn’t implement the necessary WebRTC API methods.  Possible Causes:
    * Out of date browser
  * **1004: Failure on call** - The call was attempted, but failed.  Possible Causes:
    * For a full list of causes refer here, http://sipjs.com/api/0.6.0/causes/
    * There are 24 different causes so I don’t really want to list all of them
  * **1005: Call ended unexpectedly** - The call was successful, but ended without user requesting to end the session.  Possible Causes:
    * Unknown
  * **1006: Call timed out** - The library took too long to try and connect the call.  Possible Causes:
    * Previously caused by Firefox 33-beta on Mac.   We've been unable to reproduce since release of FireFox 34
  * **1007: ICE negotiation failed** - The browser and FreeSWITCH try to negotiate ports to use to stream the media and that negotiation failed.  Possible Causes:
    * NAT is blocking the connection
    * Firewall is blocking the UDP connection/ports
  * **1008: Call transfer failed** - A timeout while waiting for FreeSWITCH to transfer from the echo test to the real conference. This might be caused by a misconfiguration in FreeSWITCH, or there might be a media error and the DTMF command to transfer didn't go through (In this case, the voice in the echo test probably didn't work either.)
  * **1009: Could not fetch STUN/TURN server information** - This indicates either a BigBlueButton bug (or you're using an unsupported new client/old server combination), but could also happen due to a network interruption.

## Reprocess Recordings from 0.81

With the update from BigBlueButton 0.81 to 0.9.0, we do not support upgrading a server in place. Instead, we recommend installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu 14.04 for BigBlueButton 0.9.0.

There are two ways of importing recordings from an old BigBlueButton server to a new one; they are described separately.


### Re-process raw recordings from an old server

This is the recommended way of copying recordings, since the recordings will be rebuilt using newer versions of the recording software, enabling new features and fixing bugs that may have been present with the old version. The downside is that this can take a long time, and will use a lot of CPU on your new BigBlueButton server while you wait for the recordings to process.

If your old server has all of the original recording files in the `/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw` directory, then you can transfer these files to the new server, for example with rsync:

This example rsync command could be run on the new server, and will copy the recording file from the old server.

```
rsync -rP root@bbb-0-81-server:/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/ /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/
```

There are other ways of transferring these files; for example, you could create a tar archive of the `/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw` directory, and copy it with scp, or use a shared NFS mount. Any method should work fine.

You will then need to fix the permissions on the newly copied recordings:

```
chown -R tomcat7:tomcat7 /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw
```

And initiate the recording re-processing

```
bbb-record --rebuildall
```

The BigBlueButton server will automatically go through the recordings and rebuild and publish them. You can use the `bbb-record --watch` command to see the progress.

### Transfer existing published recordings from an 0.81 server

If you want to do the minimum amount of work to quickly make your existing recordings on a 0.81 server available on a BigBlueButton 0.9.0 server, transfer the contents of the `/var/bigbluebutton/published` and `/var/bigbluebutton/unpublished` directories. In addition, to preserve the backup of the original raw media, you should transfer the contents of the `/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw` directory.

Here is an example set of rsync commands that would accomplish this; run these on the new server to copy the files from the old server.

```
rsync -rP root@bbb-0-81-server:/var/bigbluebutton/published/ /var/bigbluebutton/published/
rsync -rP root@bbb-0-81-server:/var/bigbluebutton/unpublished/ /var/bigbluebutton/unpublished/
rsync -rP root@bbb-0-81-server:/var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/ /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/
```

Other methods of transferring these files can also be used; for example, you could create a tar archive of each of the directories, and transfer it via scp, or use a shared NFS mount.

You will then need to fix the permissions on the newly copied recordings:

```
chown -R tomcat7:tomcat7 /var/bigbluebutton/published /var/bigbluebutton/unpublished /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw
```

The transferred recordings should be immediately visible via the BigBlueButton recordings API.

Finally, if you are transferring recordings from a BigBlueButton 0.80 server, they may have been done in an older recording format called "slides". In order to correctly play back these recordings on a new BigBlueButton server, you will have to install an additional package:

```
apt-get install bbb-playback-slides
```
