# Overview

This document gives you an overview of BigBlueButton 2.6, the latest version of BigBlueButton now in development.

*Note:* This document is DRAFT and will be expanded upon as 2.6 development goes through alpha, beta, and release.

BigBlueButton 2.6 offers users improved usability, increased engagement, and more performance.

- **Usability** - making common functions (such as raise hand) easier
- **Engagement** - giving the instructor more ways to engage students
- **Performance** - increasing overall performance and scalability

Here's a breakdown of what's new in 2.6.

## Usability

### Dark theme

BigBlueButton supports dark theme. To enable it just navigate to the Settings.

<br /><br />

### Improved Echo Test dialog
The echo test modal has added a new audio stream volume indicator in place of the
separate confirmation screen. This reduced the number of views and interactions required for audio confirmation.

### Improved notification of recording start

The indicator for whether the recording is on has been made bigger. Additionally if you create your meeting with an optional parameter `notifyRecordingIsOn=true`, you users will see the following dialog when the recording commenses and also when joining a session that is already actively being recorded. You can choose to either continue or leave the session.

<br /><br />

### Allow pinning of more than one webcam

The pinning feature prevents the webcams from being rotated out when audio floor switching is activated.
This functionality is specially important for document and/or interpreter cameras. It has also been improved
to support miltiple pinned cameras.

### Upload your own webcam background

This new feature allows a user to upload virtual background image's for their webcam. The user can upload 
and delete images at will.

### Set webcam image brightness

Allows the ability to adjust the brightness levels of their webcam (or) webcam and background image.

This is done via the webcam settings modal using the brightness slider at the bottom.

### Improved layouts manager selection

Layout selection can now be done via the updated layout selection modal located in the actions (+) button.

<img src="/images/26layout-selection.gif" alt="Animation selecting actions button and layout selection item" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;"/>

### Live Automatic Closed Captions

The feature is divided into 2 parts: transcription and display.

Transcription:

The automatic transcription is only available for browsers that support SpeechRecognition (Google Chrome, MS Edge and Safari). So those who join a meeting using other browsers will see a warning in the audio modal.

<img src="/images/26-no-voice-rec.png" alt="audio modal with speech recognition error" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;"/>

Folks who want to have their voices transcribed must enable it by selecting the desired language from the drop-down selector in the audio modal.

<img src="/images/26-auto-transcription.png" alt="audio modal with automatic transcription dropdown" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;"/>

The default selected value in the automatic transcription language selector is disabled. This can be changed in the settings file.

The talking indicator of users who have enabled automatic transcription is shown with a CC icon next to it.

<img src="/images/26-cc-talking-indicator.png" alt="Talking indicator with closed caption icon" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;"/>

Display:

Closed captions viewing is completely independent from the transcription, as users with disabled automatic transcription can still see the transcription of those who've enabled it.

To visualize what is being transcribed from other users, just toggle the CC button.

The CC button only appears if the automatic transcript was/is being used in the meeting(at least one user spoke with it enabled).

The CC button placement:

	Desktop devices: it's in the actions bar bottom left.

  <img src="/images/26-cc-desktop-btn.png" alt="closed captions button on action bar" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;"/>
  
	Mobile devices: it's in the three dots at the top right corner.

### Downloading presentation with whiteboard annotations included

Teachers can now export their slide decks with the annotations added during a lesson.
Selecting "Send to chat" in the presentation upload modal sends a link in the public chat from which meeting participants can download the file.

<img src="/images/26-send-to-chat.png" alt="BigBlueButton's upload modal with a button to export the presentation with annotations" style="max-width: auto; height: auto;"/>

### Upload a presentation straight from NextCloud

Two new create parameters: uploadExternalDescription and uploadExternalUrl have been introduced.

The client supports these parameters, displaying a message in the presentation upload modal when both values are set at meeting creation.

<img src="/images/26-next-cloud.png" alt="Upload presentation modal with next cloud message" style="max-width: auto; height: auto;"/>

### Easier moving of users between breakout rooms

There is a new option for the breakout room controls called Manage users.

<img src="/images/26-manage-users.png" alt="Manage users" style="max-width: auto; height: auto;"/>

This dialog lets you drag-and-drop users between different breakout rooms.  


<img src="/images/26-move-user.gif" alt="Move users dialog" style="max-width: auto; height: auto;"/>

When you click Apply, BigBlueButton well send prompts to each user to move them to the target breakout room.

### Recording in MP4 format

This release will introduce a new recording format that creates a single video file from audio, video, screen share, presentation, and whiteboard marks recorded during the session.  The file format will be .vp8 (with configuration options to alternatively create an .mp4 file as well).

## Engagement

### Fully reimplemented whiteboard (tl;draw)

The whiteboard has been updated with TLdraw, a small appication which supports improved drawing features.

For more details see https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw.

### Exporting Shared notes to the whiteboard

Instructors can move the shared notes to the whiteboard presentation area for further collaborative work among students.
