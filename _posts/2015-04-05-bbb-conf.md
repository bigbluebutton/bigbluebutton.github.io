# Introduction

`bbb-conf` is the BigBlueButton configuration script for modifying BigBlueButton's configuration, managing the BigBlueButton processes (start/stop/reset), and troubleshooting your installation.

If you are installing BigBlueButton from source, you can download `bbb-conf` from [here](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/bigbluebutton-config/bin/bbb-conf).

When installed from packages, `bbb-conf` is located in `/usr/local/bin/bbb-conf`.  If you are a developer, look through the source for `bbb-conf` (it's a shell script) will help you understand the various components of BigBlueButton and how they work together.

# Options

# Troubleshooting
In some cases the IP of the VM maybe change while initializing for the first time and, consequently, the BigBlueButton config files would be setup with the wrong IP address. If you're running into problems, execute the following command.

```
   sudo bbb-conf --check
```

If the IP in BigBlueButton's config files don't match the IP of your VM, you will see something like the following.

![bbbconf-wrongip](/images/bbbconf-wrongip.png)

To resolve this,  run this command:

```
   bbb-conf --setip <hostname_or_ip>
```
