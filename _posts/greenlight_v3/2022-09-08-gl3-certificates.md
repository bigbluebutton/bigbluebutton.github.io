## Creating Letsencrypt SSL certificates

***If you ALREADY have valid SSL certificates for your FQDNs or a wildcard certificate that you are willing to use for the deployment, please skip to [Custom Certificates](#custom-certificates).***

There should be two public FQDNs that points to our system with the web ports open for inbound traffic: one for Greenlight, one for Keycloak.

Run the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script which will automate the issuing of the certificates for the FQDNs:

```bash
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

The script will load the environmental variables and request a certificate from Letsencrypt for each defined FQDN.

If there are no issues, you should be prompted the following: **Existing data found. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N).**

![Lets Encrpyt](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/init-letsencrypt.png)

This is to avoid overwriting any existing certificates by re-running the script. Since this is the first time a certificate is generated, the directory content can be overwritten by typing “**y”.**

After generating the certificates, please be aware that accepting the replacement will replace the previously created certificates.

After continuing, the script will download the required TLS configurations and initiate the generation process for each FQDN.

![Lets Encrpyt](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/init-letsencrypt-2.png)

Then, the script will load the required ACME challenges and ask you to complete the challenge:

![Lets Encrpyt](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/init-letsencrypt-3.png)

At this step, you may notice the new files that were loaded into your system under the **./data/certbot/www** directory. Those are the challenge files which are part of the process:

![Lets Encrpyt](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/init-letsencrypt-4.png)

Press **ENTER** to continue the challenge:

![Lets Encrpyt](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/init-letsencrypt-5.png)

At this step, you have successfully created a valid SSL certificate for your first FQDN.

You will be prompted to repeat the process for the remaining FQDN.

***If you have removed Keycloak, you will not be prompted to generate a second certificate.***

The certificates files will be placed under **data/certbot/conf/live/** in a directory named after their FQDN. This is required for nginx.

For example, for ***DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc***, there would be two directories: **data/certbot/conf/live/gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/** and **data/certbot/conf/live/kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/**.

***NOTE: Since there are different FQDNs, there will be different directory names.
However, the directory names should match their FQDNs.***

You can verify that the directories were created by listing them:

```bash
sudo ls -R data/certbot/conf/live
```

![Lets Encrpyt](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/init-letsencrypt-6.png)


Both the directories should exist, and have their names fully matching the FQDNs. Otherwise, **nginx will fail** due to trying to load inexistent files in the upcoming steps.

We have fully generated SSL certificates for our FQDNs. However, if the **LETSENCRYPT_STAGING** default value has not been changed, the staging certificates will be used instead of the production ones.

***We enable staging by default to avoid reaching the rate limits because of any encountered issues.***

To generate valid SSL certificates for the FQDNs after this successful test, please change the **LETSENCRYPT_STAGING** default value to **0** and re-run the script while redoing the same steps**.**

```bash
sed -i "s/LETSENCRYPT_STAGING**=1**/LETSENCRYPT_STAGING=0/" .env
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

***NOTE:* It is expected to *replace existing staging certificates.***

Once you are finished, you can skip to [Updating NGINX and Starting Greenlight](#updating-nginx-and-starting-greenlight)

## Custom Certificates
### Custom Letsencrypt certificates

If your custom certificates were generated by letsencrypt (certbot) for each of your FQDNs, you can copy the certificates data and cache (renewal configurations, archive files, live files,…) or the whole letsencrypt directory ‘**/etc/letsencrypt/**’ into ‘**~/greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf**’ (make sure that it does not contain any other irrelevant certificates).

However, the only constraint is that you had generated two standalone certificates, one for each of your FQDNs matching what you have as “**$GL_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME**” **and** “**$KC_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME**”.

```bash
cd ~
sudo mkdir -p greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf/live/
sudo cp -r /etc/letsencrypt/ greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf
```

---

#### Renewing Certificates

By default, Greenlight has a **certbot** service that is responsible for automatically renewing the certificates, storing your existing Letsencrypt certificates to ‘**~/greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf**’ with a **certbot** service in place to manage the renewal.

However, if you have not used Letsencrypt to issue the certificates, you will be responsible for the renewals.

For that, you may need to remove the certbot service, since you won’t need it.

To disable the **certbot** service, please remove the highlighted lines in the image below on **~/greenlight-run/docker-compose.yaml**:

Before, please stop Greenlight:

```bash
cd ~/greenlight-run
sudo docker compose down
```

![Certbot Dockercompose](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/certbot-dockercompose.png)

And **save** the changes.

Once you are finished, you can skip to [Updating NGINX and Starting Greenlight](#updating-nginx-and-starting-greenlight)

---

### Custom External Certficates

Go to the home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

Nginx expects two directories named after each FQDN located under **~/greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf/live** having the following certificates files each: the full chain **fullchain.pem** and the private key **privkey.pem**.

Keycloak instance will also expect the certificate file to be present in a **cert.pem** named file under the Keycloak certificate directroy.

***If you have followed the Greenlight without Keycloak guide, you are required to create a single directory named after Greenlight FQDN containing the fullchain.pem and privkey.pem files.***

For the custom certificates, there should be two directories named after each FQDN.

For a **DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl** and **KC_HOSTNAME=kc**, there should be two directories: **gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org** and **kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org**.

Assign the certificates directories under the home directory and store the **fullchain.pem and privkey.pem** of each certificate under its directory along with the **cert.pem** of Keycloak under its certificate directory. 

Make sure that the directories names matches those on the **.env as: ‘$GL_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’** and **‘$KC_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’** (required only if Keycloak is enabled).

Once you are finished, you can skip to [Updating NGINX and Starting Greenlight](#updating-nginx-and-starting-greenlight)

---

### Multi domain and wildcard certificates

The following guide is expecting two standalone certificates, each targeting one FQDN. One for Greenlight and another for Keycloak.

However, those assertions may be redundant for some deployments using a none standalone certificate for both FQDNs.

***For that, you only need to do this extra step before proceeding:***

Copy the composite certificate files **fullchain.pem, privkey.pem and cert.pem** in your home directory in a directory named after Greenlight FQDN that would match what you have on **.env** file as ‘**$GL_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’**.

Then, create a **relative** symbolic link named after Keycloak FQDN that links to the composite certificate directory (the directory named after Greenlight FQDN).

Edit the following command and run it:

- **\<YOUR_GL_FQDN\>**: is a placeholder for your Greenlight FQDN, in our example that would be ‘**gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org**’, for your deployment that should match ‘**$GL_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’**.
- **\<YOUR_KC_FQDN\>**: is a placeholder for your Keycloak FQDN, in our example that would be ‘**kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org**’, for your deployment that should match ‘**$KC_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’.**



```bash
sudo ln -s ./<YOUR_GL_FQDN> <YOUR_KC_FQDN>
```

Following the example, you should have something similar to:

![Fullchain](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/fullchain.png)

Now, you can follow the rest of the guide and have the expected outcome while using a composite certificate.

---

Following the example, we should have something like:

![Fullchain](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/fullchain-2.png)

*If you are using a composite certificate, it is expected that both directories have the same content.*

Now, please copy the certificates directories in their expected location:

- **\<YOUR_GL_FQDN\>**: is a placeholder for your Greenlight FQDN, in our example that would be ‘**gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org**’, for your deployment that should match ‘**$GL_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’**.
- **\<YOUR_KC_FQDN\>**: is a placeholder for your Keycloak FQDN, in our example that would be ‘**kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org**’, for your deployment that should match ‘**$KC_HOSTNAME.$DOMAIN_NAME’.**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf/live/
sudo cp -r <YOUR_GL_FQDN>/ greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf/live/
sudo cp -r <YOUR_KC_FQDN>/ greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf/live/ # Only, if you use Keycloak
```

 ******

You can verify that your certificates were copied by listing them:

```bash
sudo ls -R greenlight-run/data/certbot/conf/live/
```

![Fullchain](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/fullchain-3.png)

*If you are using a composite certificate, it is expected that both directories will have the same content.*

*If you have followed the guides to remove Keycloak it’s expected to not having its certificate directory.*

Once you're finished, you can continue to [Updating NGINX and Starting Greenlight](#updating-nginx-and-starting-greenlight)

## Updating NGINX and Starting Greenlight

We now need to update our nginx configuration file to open **HTTPS** traffic. You can do so manually by going to **./data/nginx/sites.template-*** files and uncommenting all lines for the HTTPS binding and SSL certificate files locations.

Or, for your convenience, run:

```bash
cd ~/greenlight-run
sed -i "/#listen.*/s/#//g" ./data/nginx/sites.template-*
sed -i "/#ssl_certificate.*/s/#//g" ./data/nginx/sites.template-*
sed -i "/#.*\/data\/certbot\/conf\/live\/.*/s/#//g" docker-compose.yml
```

Now, restart the services:

```bash
sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
```

Accessing your Greenlight and Keycloak instances through their HTTPS enabled URLs should be possible now.

So, for a **DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc.**, Greenlight is accessible at [https://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/) and Keycloak at [https://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/).

When encountering any issues with nginx, you can restart the server with the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose restart nginx
```

You can verify the validity of your SSL certificates with your browser. When accessing your URLs, you should have a valid SSL status:

![HTTPS](/images/greenlight/v3/certificates/https.png)

**Congratulations** on following the steps until this point! Now, you should have a production ready setup with our recommended configuration set and apt for using.
