Greenlight is a minimalistic room manager for the BigBlueButton (BBB) project.

Greenlight is an open source [LGPL-3.0 licensed](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/blob/master/LICENSE) web application that enables organizations having a BigBlueButton server with a complete web conferencing platform in a matter of minutes while being simple to set and to use for both regular and power users.

Greenlight is built using state of the art technology stacks that empowers millions of projects and trusted by big corporations, all while being conform with its licensing subject and the expectations of our community.

Greenlight in its third edition was re-built from scratch, so it is a completely new application that uses new modern software engineering standards and designs.

Greenlight v3 is user friendly, simple to set, administer and use.

Greenlight v3 is a full stack web application built with the latest versions of both [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Besides technical aspects of Greenlight v3, the project in its core kept the same values of Greenlight while approaching the same set of features in a much better and simpler way leveraging the experience we had maintaining Greenlight in its previous versions throughout the past years.

---

# **Alpha release:**

Greenlight v3 is still in its Alpha version, for the full list of the available features and their status on this release please refer to ***(TODO).***

For any suggestions, notes, encountered issues or questions kindly refer to the Greenlight official repository: [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/)
And the Google community group: [https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-greenlight](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-greenlight)

# Installation steps:

## Prerequisites:

The following guides requires that your system has two valid FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names) one for Greenlight and another Keycloak that we will configure the nginx proxy to expect**.**

So for example, an organization having a public valid domain name of **[xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://xlab.bigbluebutton.org),** it may create two DNS records one with a hostname of “**gl**” and another of “**kc**” forming two valid public FQDNs that points to their system public IP address.

We will configure the scripts and services afterwards to use those public valid FQDNs [gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org) and [kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org) for Greenlight and Keycloak.

If you do not want to have Keycloak installed please refer to this guide **Greenlight without Keycloak** on what to change to deploy Greenlight without Keycloak **before proceeding**.

***To create these new FQDNs please refer to your DNS registrar and* follow** ***their guides on how to add new records.***

Once done, it may take some time for the DNS updates to propagate through the network so please make sure that the records became available.

You can refer to these platforms for verification [https://www.whatsmydns.net/](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).

We also expect that both of the FQDNs points to your local system public IP address and that you have web ports (both **HTTP(TCP 80)** and **HTTPS(TCP 443)** ) opened for inbound traffic.

We’ve prepared some scripts and commands to help you deploy Greenlight at ease, for that we’d expect that you have a Unix-like system with Bash installed and available in the **$PATH** under **/bin/bash.**

All of the following instructions were tested on the latest version of the **ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution v20.04.4 LTS (focal)**.

*If you’re using a different distribution please make sure to have **Bash** installed and accessible in your **$PATH** under **/bin/bash.***

It’s expected that these requirements will be easily met - however, you can refer to your sysadmins to help you prepare your environment to meet such requirements.

---

## Installing Docker:

Greenlight is a modern web application that was designed to be as simple to operate and manage as possible.

Greenlight is “dockerized” meaning that it can be deployed to any container based platform.

With few steps, we will have a production ready setup of Greenlight deployed with our recommended configuration.

To run docker containers we’d need to have docker engine set up and a docker client.

Also we’d need docker compose to simplify the set up of Greenlight since it is a distributed application that leverages more than a single service.

You can use [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) which will include all of these dependencies and a Graphical UI that will further simplify containers management for you.

Or you can follow the steps to install each dependency individually documented as in [Docker’s official guides](https://docs.docker.com/).

We’d need [docker engine and client](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) along with the [docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-plugin/).

Note: Some systems may have and been already using the docker-compose utility.

docker-compose is the first compose project introduced by Docker community and they are shifting towards the use of the new compose plugin.

At the moment of this writing both utilities works but it’s recommended to start using the compose subcommand where the docker-compose utility will be declared as deprecated.

*However, Greenlight setup scripts were made to work on what you have available on your system.*

***In these guides we will be using `docker compose` in the commands, you can still use `docker-compose` utility in place without any issues.***

If you have [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed all should be already set otherwise please follow the guides to setup [Docker on your system](https://docs.docker.com/).

If docker dependencies are installed correctly running the following commands should have a similar output:

```bash
sudo docker version
sudo docker compose version # sudo docker-compose version
```

***NOTE: You do not have to install both of docker compose and docker-compose, having one in your system is enough to follow the guides.***

After verifying that docker utilities has been installed correctly we’re left with few steps to follow.

---

## Cloning the repository:

We have included few deployment scripts to facilitate the setup of Greenlight in this dedicated GitHub [public repository](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight-run/).

The scripts are written in Bash, if your system does not have Bash installed and you run into issues please refer to your distribution documentation on how to install Bash, the scripts **will be expecting the Bash binaries to be under “/bin/bash”.**

We’d start by cloning the repository in our local system for that we’d need to have **git** CLI installed.

To verify that `**git**` is installed you can run:

```bash
git version
```

You should have a message indicating the installed version in your system.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ded59aa7-ec8d-4e5b-a20b-24945c75635c/Untitled.png)

If not installed please refer to the official documentations on how to install **git.**

Lets place our selves under the home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

To clone the repository we’d run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kh-amir-tn/greenlight-run
cd greenlight-run
git checkout beta_1
```

Then we’d like to create the **.env** files, for that we’d run:

```bash
cp data/greenlight/dotenv data/greenlight/.env
cp dotenv .env
```

---

## Setting environmental variables:

Most Greenlight required variables are pre-set by default, there’s only few to set yourself.

For documentation purposes we include the tables below to further describe the required environmental variables that we need to set, their purpose and our recommendations.

To check the full list of all Greenlight environmental variables, please refer to **Greenlight environmental variables**.

**./.env:**

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL | The email address to use when generating Let’s encrypt SSL (x509) certificates withinit-letsencrypt.sh script. | - | YES (when using the init-letsencrypt.sh script) |
| LETSENCRYPT_STAGING | Defines wither to run certbot with the --staging option or not (0:Without,1:With) when generating SSL certificates with our init-letsencrypt.sh script to avoid reaching rate limits. | 1 | NO |
| DOMAIN_NAME | The domain name that greenlight and keycloak will be accessible through.
The domain name should be a valid DNS name that has active records registered in the DNS network.
This is required for generating SSL certificates. | - | YES |
| GL_HOSTNAME | The Greenlight hostname.
Along with the DOMAIN_NAME variable this will form the FQDN for Greenlight. | gl | YES |
| KC_HOSTNAME | The Keycloak hostname.
Along with the DOMAIN_NAME variable this will form the FQDN for Keycloak. | kc | YES (when deploying Keycloak) |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | The password for the Postgres super user.
It’s required to set this to a secure random complex value. | - | YES |
| KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD | The Keycloak admin account password.
It’s required to set this to a secure inaccessible random complex value. | - | YES (when deploying Keycloak) |

**./data/greenlight/.env:**

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATABASE_URL | The URI of the Postgres instance.
This should match the following format:
postgres://postgres:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@postgres:5432 | - | YES |
| SECRET_KEY_BASE | A secret key that Greenlight will use for cryptographic purposes.
It’s required to set this to a secure inaccessible random complex value. | - | YES |

All **none** required variables should be already preset.

You can edit variables in the .**env** files by uncommenting (removing any # at the start of) the line that defines the variable and change their values with the following syntax `VARIABLE_NAME=**<Your_Value>**`.

For required variables (those **not** commented but empty) you can edit them directly or run these commands for your convivence.

Kindly change the values to your preference on these commands before running them:

- **<Your_Domain_Name>** should match your domain name i.e. “**xlab.bigbluebutton.org”.**
- **<YOUR_GL_HOSTNAME>** is a placeholder for your Greenlight hostname i.e. “**www”** along with **DOMAIN_NAME** variable this will form Greenlight public FQDN which in our example would be “**www.xlab.bigbluebutton.org”**.
- **<YOUR_KC_HOSTNAME>** is a placeholder for your Keycloak hostname i.e. “**kc”** along with **DOMAIN_NAME** variable this will form Keycloak public FQDN which in our example would be “**kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org”** (This is only required if you have **not** followed **Greenlight without Keycloak** guide).
- **<Email_Address_To_Use_By_Letsencrypt>** is a placeholder for your email address.

```bash
sed -i "s/DOMAIN_NAME=.*/DOMAIN_NAME=**<Your_Domain_Name>**/" .env
sed -i "s/GL_HOSTNAME=gl/GL_HOSTNAME=**<YOUR_GL_HOSTNAME>**/" .env
sed -i "s/KC_HOSTNAME=kc/KC_HOSTNAME=**<YOUR_KC_HOSTNAME>**/" .env # Required only when using Keycloak.
sed -i "s/LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=.*/LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=**<Email_Address_To_Use_By_Letsencrypt>**/" .env
```

Please note that it’s highly recommended to generate a secure complex random secrets and passwords so unless it’s necessary it’s not suggested to set those variables manually.

For your convivence run these commands to auto generate secure random complex secrets:

```bash
sed -i "s/SECRET_KEY_BASE=.*/SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -hex 64)/" data/greenlight/.env
psql_pwd="$(openssl rand -hex 40)";kc_pwd="$(openssl rand -hex 40)"
sed -i "s/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=.*/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$psql_pwd/" .env
sed -i "s/KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=.*/KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=$kc_pwd/" .env
sed -i "s/DATABASE_URL=.*/DATABASE_URL=postgres:\/\/postgres:$psql_pwd@postgres:5432/" data/greenlight/.env
unset psql_pwd kc_pwd;
```

Now all is set we’d only need to create the database for keycloak.

*If you have followed **Greenlight without Keycloak** guide you can skip the next section **Creating Keycloak database** into **Starting Greenlight**.*

---

## Creating Keycloak database:

***If you are not willing to use Keycloak, please refer to this guide Greenlight without Keycloak.***

**If you had followed the guide to remove Keycloak service then feel free to skip this section into the next one.**

To do that just run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose up postgres -d
```

That will start our postgres instance as configured and any service it depends on **only**.

Now we need to access it and create the keycloak database needed by Keycloak application, for that please run:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE keycloakdb;'
```

You should an output similar to this:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/175cec6a-6aa3-4aab-aa08-7f8473eea24c/Untitled.png)

---

## Starting Greenlight:

Now everything is set,

We’d simply start Greenlight services through the docker compose:

```bash
 sudo docker compose up -d
```

You can verify the containers status by running:

```bash
sudo docker container ls
```

You should have an output similar to this:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/39885849-a68f-44bc-b93d-0a939d62225a/Untitled.png)

***Note: If you have followed the steps on how to disable Keycloak it is normal to have a slightly different output that looks similar but does not contain the keycloak container.***

Notice how all Greenlight services are having an **Up** and **not** a **Restarting|Exited** status which indicates a problem, so all is up and running without any encountered issues.

Now you should be able to access your Greenlight and and Keycloak instances through their URLs

So for a **DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc.**

You can access Greenlight through:  [http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/) and Keycloak through [http://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/).

***It is normal to get a 502 Bad Gateway error from nginx that does indicate probably that* Greenlight** ***(respectively Keycloak) service has not fully started.***

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ff206794-e63d-413d-91c6-c89ead390b86/Untitled.png)

**Kindly *wait for a minute and retry.***

You should see the landing pages.

You may want to restart the nginx service if you came across nginx welcome page instead:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/788f9cc6-6019-4ef4-865e-dcdb164b2abf/Untitled.png)



```bash
sudo docker compose restart nginx
```

Greenlight landing page:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9b7dd7da-fc30-4aa5-b94d-ec3e82ea718a/Untitled.png)

Keycloak landing page:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/38f360c1-9c5e-4533-8065-a74122497b01/Untitled.png)

Greenlight at this point is accessible through **HTTP** only.

However, we do **not recommend** the use of the **HTTP** plain protocol unless for **testing purposes**, besides Keycloak and some browser features on Greenlight will only be available through **HTTPS** so for your **security** and the **convenience** of your users *we highly encourage you to follow the next steps to enable secure HTTPS access to Greenlight.*

---

## Creating Letsencrypt SSL certificates:

***If you do have valid SSL certificates to your FQDNs* (Fully Qualified Domain Names) *or a wildcard certificate that you’re willing to use for your deployment please skip the rest of this guide and refer to the guide Greenlight with custom SSL certificates on how to use your certificates instead.***

Now we have two public FQDNs that points to our system with the web ports opened for inbound traffic one for Greenlight and another for Keycloak.

Now we’d run the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script which will automate the issuing of the certificates for our FQDNs:

```bash
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

The script will load the environmental variables and  start requesting a certificate from Letsencrypt for each defined FQDN.

If there’s no issues you should be prompted that **Existing data found . Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N).**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/31c6b5ea-3f12-4d59-a661-a300d0cebaa9/Untitled.png)

Do not worry, this is due to avoiding overwriting any existing certificates by re-running the script, since this is our first time you can overwrite the directory content by typing “**y”.**

After generating the certificates please be aware that accepting the replacement will replace previously created certificates .

After continuing, the script will download required TLS configurations and initiate the generation process for each FQDN.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1bf2e793-3609-4ec1-8563-047e90ac925d/Untitled.png)

Then the script will load required ACME challenges and ask you to complete the challenge by continuing:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8279f47a-954d-4d37-b86d-ee880e2f5de7/Untitled.png)

At this step you may notice new files were loaded into your system under the **./data/certbot/www** directory those are the challenge files and it’s part of the process:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/60ac4c8a-cf97-4b53-89e9-20b5814ed38a/Untitled.png)

Just press **ENTER** to continue the challenge:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6e9fea66-86e3-41ef-b03b-40dc2503556c/Untitled.png)

At this step you have successfully created a valid SSL certificate for your first FQDN.

You will be prompted to replay the same steps for the remaining FQDN.

***In case you’ve followed the guide Greenlight without Keycloak it’s expected that you will not be prompted to generate a second certificate.***

The certificates files will be placed under **data/certbot/conf/live/** each in a directory named after their FQDN this is required for nginx to work however if you have custom requirements like having custom certificates that you’re willing to use please refer to the guides ***Greenlight with custom SSL certificates***.

In our example for a ***DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc*** we would have two directories **data/certbot/conf/live/gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/** and **data/certbot/conf/live/kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/.**

***NOTE: Since you will have different FQDNs, you will have different directory names.
However, the directory names should match their FQDNs.***

You can verify that directories were created by listing them:

```bash
sudo ls -R data/certbot/conf/live
```

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e2677da0-9854-48ef-9ffa-73bbea0d97ec/Untitled.png)

Both of the directories should exist and have their names fully matching the FQDNs otherwise **nginx will fail** due to trying loading inexistent files in the upcoming steps.

We have fully generated SSL certificates for our FQDNs, however - if haven’t changed the **LETSENCRYPT_STAGING** default value those will be staging certificates and not production ones.

***We enable staging by default to avoid reaching rate limits because of any encountered issues.***

To generate valid SSL certificates for the FQDNs after this successful test, kindly change the **LETSENCRYPT_STAGING** default value to **0** and re-run the script while replaying the same steps**.**

```bash
sed -i "s/LETSENCRYPT_STAGING**=1**/LETSENCRYPT_STAGING=0/" .env
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

***NOTE:* Replacing existing *staging certificates is expected.***

We now need to update our nginx configuration file to open **HTTPS** traffic, you can do so manually by going to **./data/nginx/sites.template-*** files ****and uncommenting (Removing the **#** prefix on) all lines for the HTTPS binding and SSL certificate files locations.

Or, for your convivence you can run:

```bash
sed -i "/#listen.*/s/#//g" ./data/nginx/sites.template-*
sed -i "/#ssl_certificate.*/s/#//g" ./data/nginx/sites.template-*
sed -i "/#.*\/data\/certbot\/conf\/live\/.*/s/#//g" docker-compose.yml
```

Now we restart the services:

```bash
sudo docker compose down && sudo docker compose up -d
```

Accessing your Greenlight and Keycloak instances through their HTTPS enabled URLs should be possible now.

So for a **DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc.**

You can access Greenlight through:  [https://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/) and Keycloak through [https://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/).

When encountering any issues with nginx you can restart it by:

```bash
sudo docker compose restart nginx
```

You can verify the validity of your SSL certificates through your browser, when accessing your URLs you should have a valid SSL status:

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/24697341-237a-4a88-97b6-6a72b9aa5b41/Untitled.png)

**Congratulations** on following the steps until this point, now you have a production ready setup with our recommended configuration set and apt for using.
