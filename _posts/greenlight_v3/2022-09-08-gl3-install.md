# **Alpha release**
**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Greenlight v3 is still in its Alpha version, and therefore, is **NOT** a production ready application. It contains some missing/incomplete features and should only be used for testing and exploration.

For any suggestions, notes, encountered issues or questions kindly refer to the Greenlight official repository: [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/)
And the Google community group: [https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-greenlight](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-greenlight)

---

Greenlight is an open source [LGPL-3.0 licensed](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/blob/master/LICENSE) web application that enables organizations having a BigBlueButton server with a complete web conferencing platform in a matter of minutes while being simple to set and to use for both regular and power users.

Greenlight v3 is a full stack web application built with the latest versions of both [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). This stack empowers millions of projects and is trusted by big corporations, all while conforming with Greenlight's licensing subject and the expectations of our community.


# Installation steps

## Prerequisites

The following guides requires that your system has two valid FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names) one for Greenlight and another Keycloak that we will configure the nginx proxy to expect**.**

So for example, an organization having a public valid domain name of **[xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://xlab.bigbluebutton.org),** it may create two DNS records one with a hostname of “**gl**” and another of “**kc**” forming two valid public FQDNs that points to their system public IP address.

We will configure the scripts and services afterwards to use those public valid FQDNs [gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org) and [kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org) for Greenlight and Keycloak.

***To create these new FQDNs please refer to your DNS registrar and* follow** ***their guides on how to add new records.***

Once done, it may take some time for the DNS updates to propagate through the network so please make sure that the records became available. You can refer to these platforms for verification [https://www.whatsmydns.net/](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).

We also expect that both of the FQDNs points to your local system public IP address and that you have web ports (both **HTTP(TCP 80)** and **HTTPS(TCP 443)** ) opened for inbound traffic.

## Installing Docker

To run Greenlight, you must install Docker Engine alongside a Docker Client. For this you have 2 options: 
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (recommended for Windows systems)
- [Docker Engine + Client](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-plugin/) (recommended for UNIX systems)

Note: Some systems may have and been already using the docker-compose utility.
***In these guides we will be using `docker compose` in the commands, you can still use `docker-compose` utility in place without any issues.***


If docker dependencies are installed correctly running the following commands should have a similar output:
```bash
sudo docker version
sudo docker compose version # sudo docker-compose version
```

***NOTE: You do not have to install both of docker compose and docker-compose, having one in your system is enough to follow the guides.***

---

## Cloning the repository

We have included a few deployment scripts to facilitate the setup of Greenlight in this dedicated GitHub [public repository](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight-run/).

The scripts are written in Bash, if your system does not have Bash installed and you run into issues please refer to your distribution documentation on how to install Bash, the scripts **will be expecting the Bash binaries to be under “/bin/bash”.**

We will start by cloning the repository in our local system for that we will need to have **git** CLI installed. To verify that `git` is installed you can run:

```bash
git version
```

You should have a message indicating the installed version in your system.

![Git Version](/images/greenlight/v3/install/git-version.png)

If not installed please refer to the official documentations on how to install **git.**

Lets place our selves under the home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

To clone the repository we will run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight-run.git
cd greenlight-run
git checkout alpha
```

---
## Setting environmental variables

To setup our `.env` files, we can run the following commands: 
```bash
cp data/greenlight/dotenv data/greenlight/.env
cp dotenv .env
```

In v3, there are 2 main `.env` files:
- `~/greenlight-run/.env` -> this controls the entire deployment
- `~/greenlight-run/data/greenlight/.env` -> this controls Greenlight ONLY

Most Greenlight required variables are pre-set by default, there’s only few to set yourself.

For documentation purposes we include the tables below to further describe the required environmental variables that we need to set, their purpose and our recommendations.

To check the full list of all Greenlight environmental variables, please refer to **Greenlight environmental variables**.

**./.env:**

All **non-required** variables should be already preset.

You can edit variables in the .**env** files by uncommenting (removing any # at the start of) the line that defines the variable and change their values with the following syntax `VARIABLE_NAME=**<Your_Value>**`.

For required variables (those **not** commented but empty) you can edit them directly or run these commands for your convenience.

Please note that it’s highly recommended to generate a secure complex random secrets and passwords so unless it’s necessary it’s not suggested to set those variables manually.

For your convenience, run these commands to auto generate secure random complex secrets:

```bash
sed -i "s/SECRET_KEY_BASE=.*/SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -hex 64)/" data/greenlight/.env
psql_pwd="$(openssl rand -hex 40)";kc_pwd="$(openssl rand -hex 40)"
sed -i "s/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=.*/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$psql_pwd/" .env
sed -i "s/KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=.*/KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=$kc_pwd/" .env
sed -i "s/DATABASE_URL=.*/DATABASE_URL=postgres:\/\/postgres:$psql_pwd@postgres:5432/" data/greenlight/.env
unset psql_pwd kc_pwd;
```

## Creating Keycloak database

***If you don't plan on using Keycloak, you can skip this section.***


To create your Keycloak database, just run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose up postgres -d
```

Wait a few seconds and create the keycloak database needed by Keycloak application, by runnning:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE keycloakdb;'
```

You should an output similar to this:

![Keycloak DB](/images/greenlight/v3/install/keycloak-db.png)

---

## Starting Greenlight

Now that everything is set, we will simply start Greenlight services through the docker compose:

```bash
 sudo docker compose up -d
```

You can verify the containers status by running:

```bash
sudo docker container ls
```

You should have an output similar to this:

![Docker Containers](/images/greenlight/v3/install/containers.png)

***Note: If you have followed the steps on how to disable Keycloak it is normal to have a slightly different output that looks similar but does not contain the keycloak container.***

Notice how all Greenlight services are having an **Up** status which indicates that they are all is up and running without any issues.

Now you should be able to access your Greenlight and and Keycloak instances through their URLs

So for a **DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc.** You can access Greenlight through:  [http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/) and Keycloak through [http://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/).

***If you receive a 502 Bad Gateway error, please wait few seconds and refresh the page.***
***If you receive an nginx welcome page, restart the nginx service `sudo docker compose restart nginx`***

---

## Certificates & HTTPS

Both Greenlight and Keycloak should now be accessible through **HTTP** only. 

However, we do **not recommend** the use of the **HTTP** plain protocol unless for **testing purposes**. Besides, Keycloak and some browser features on Greenlight will only be available through **HTTPS** so for your **security** and the **convenience** of your users *we highly encourage you to follow the next steps to enable secure HTTPS access to Greenlight.*

To setup your certificates to work with Greenlight, see [Certificates](/greenlight_v3/gl3-certificates.html)

---

## Keycloak & Authentication

In v3, Greenlight offers 3 ways of handling authentication:
1- Local Accounts
2- External Authentication through Keycloak
3- External Authentication through OpenId

By default, Greenlight ships with Keycloak included to provide system administrators with an easy way to configure authentication. 

To correctly configure Keycloak with your chosen Identity Provider, see [Configuring Keycloak](/gl3-keycloak.html#connecting-to-keycloak).

To connect to another authentication broker through OpenID, see [Connecting to Another OpenID Provider](/gl3-keycloak.html#connecting-to-another-openid-provider).

If don't plan on using Keycloak, and you would like to completely remove it from your system, see [Removing Keycloak](/gl3-keycloak.html#removing-keycloak).
