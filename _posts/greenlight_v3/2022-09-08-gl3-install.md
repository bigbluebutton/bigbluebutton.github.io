# **Beta release**
**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Greenlight v3 is still in Beta. Therefore, it is **NOT** a production ready application. It contains some missing/incomplete features and should only be used for testing purposes.

For any suggestions, notes, encountered issues or questions, please refer to the Greenlight official repository: [http://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/)
or the Google community group: [https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-greenlight](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-greenlight)

---

Greenlight is an open source [LGPL-3.0 licensed](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/blob/master/LICENSE) web application that enables organizations having a BigBlueButton server with a complete web conferencing platform in a matter of minutes while being simple to set and to use for both regular and power users.

Greenlight v3 is a full stack web application built with the latest versions of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). This stack empowers millions of projects and is trusted by big corporations, and is conforming with Greenlight's licensing subject and the expectations of our community.


# Installation steps

## Prerequisites

The following guide requires that your system has two valid FQDNs (Fully Qualified Domain Names) one for Greenlight and another Keycloak that we will configure the nginx proxy to expect**.**

So, for example, an organization with a valid public domain name of **[xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://xlab.bigbluebutton.org)** may create two DNS records: one with the hostname “**gl**”, and another one “**kc**”, forming two valid public FQDNs that points to their system public IP address.

We will configure the scripts and services afterwards to use the valid public FQDNs [gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org) and [kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org) for Greenlight and Keycloak.

***To create these new FQDNs, please refer to your DNS registrar and* follow** ***their guides on how to add new records.***

Once the new records have been added, it may take some time for the DNS updates to propagate through the network. Please make sure that the records are available before continuing. You can refer to these platforms for verification [https://www.whatsmydns.net/](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).

We also expect that both of the FQDNs point to your local system public IP address and that the web ports **HTTP(TCP 80)** and **HTTPS(TCP 443)** are open for inbound traffic.

## Installing Docker

To run Greenlight, you must install Docker Engine alongside a Docker Client. You have 2 options: 
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (recommended for Windows systems)
- [Docker Engine + Client](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/compose-plugin/) (recommended for UNIX systems)

Note: Some systems may be using the docker-compose utility.
***In these guides we will be using `docker compose` in the commands, but you can still use `docker-compose` utility in place without any issues.***


If docker dependencies are installed correctly, running the following commands should have a similar output:
```bash
sudo docker version
sudo docker compose version # sudo docker-compose version
```

***NOTE: You do not have to install both docker compose and docker-compose. You may use either to follow the guides.***

---

## Cloning the repository

A few deployment scripts to facilitate the setup of Greenlight are included in the dedicated GitHub [public repository](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight-run/).

The scripts are written in Bash. If your system does not have Bash installed, and you run into issues, please refer to your distribution documentation on how to install Bash. The scripts **are expecting the Bash binaries to be under “/bin/bash”.**

Start by cloning the repository in the local system. For that, the **git** CLI needs to be installed. To verify that `git` is installed, you can run:

```bash
git version
```

There should be a message indicating the installed version in your system.

![Git Version](/images/greenlight/v3/install/git-version.png)

If it is not installed, please refer to the official documentations on how to install **git.**

Go to the home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

To clone the repository, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight-run.git
cd greenlight-run
git checkout alpha
```

---
## Setting environmental variables

To setup the `.env` files, run the following commands: 
```bash
cp data/greenlight/dotenv data/greenlight/.env
cp dotenv .env
```

In v3, there are 2 main `.env` files:
- `~/greenlight-run/.env` (for the entire deployment)
- `~/greenlight-run/data/greenlight/.env` (for Greenlight ONLY)

Most of Greenlight required variables are preset by default, but there are a few variables that have to be set manually.

For documentation purposes, the tables below are included to further describe the required environmental variables that need to be set, their purpose and the recommendations.

To check the full list of all Greenlight environmental variables, please refer to **Greenlight environmental variables**.

**./.env:**

| SECRET_KEY_BASE | A secret key used by Greenlight for cryptographic purposes. It is required to set this to a secure inaccessible random complex value. | -                                                                                                                              | YES |

All **non-required** variables should be already preset.

The variables in the .**env** files can be edited by uncommenting the line that defines the variable and change the values with the following syntax `VARIABLE_NAME=<VALUE>`.

The required variables (those **not** commented but empty) can be edited directly or run these commands for your convenience.

Please note that it is highly recommended to generate secure complex random secrets and passwords - it is suggested **not** to set those variables manually.

For convenience, these commands can be run to auto generate secure random complex secrets:

```bash
sed -i "s/SECRET_KEY_BASE=.*/SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -hex 64)/" data/greenlight/.env
psql_pwd="$(openssl rand -hex 40)";kc_pwd="$(openssl rand -hex 40)"
sed -i "s/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=.*/POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$psql_pwd/" .env
sed -i "s/KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=.*/KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=$kc_pwd/" .env
sed -i "s/DATABASE_URL=.*/DATABASE_URL=postgres:\/\/postgres:$psql_pwd@postgres:5432/" data/greenlight/.env
unset psql_pwd kc_pwd;
```

## Creating Keycloak database

***If you don't plan on using Keycloak, you can skip this section.***


To create the Keycloak database, run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose up postgres -d
```

Wait a few seconds, then create the keycloak database needed by Keycloak application by running the following:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE keycloakdb;'
```

It should output something similar to this:

![Keycloak DB](/images/greenlight/v3/install/keycloak-db.png)

---

## Starting Greenlight

Now that everything is set, start the Greenlight services through docker compose:

```bash
 sudo docker compose up -d
```

Verify the containers status by running:

```bash
sudo docker container ls
```

It should output something similar to this:

![Docker Containers](/images/greenlight/v3/install/containers.png)

***Note: If you have followed the steps on how to disable Keycloak, it is normal to have a slightly different output that looks similar but does not contain the keycloak container.***

Notice the **Up** status of all the Greenlight services, which indicate that they are up and running without any issues.

Now, you should be able to access your Greenlight and and Keycloak instances through their URLs.

For example, for **DOMAIN_NAME=xlab.bigbluebutton.org, GL_HOSTNAME=gl and KC_HOSTNAME=kc**, Greenlight is accessible at [http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/) and Keycloak at [http://kc.xlab.bigbluebutton.org](http://gl.xlab.bigbluebutton.org/).

***If you receive a 502 Bad Gateway error, please wait a few seconds and refresh the page.***
***If you see the nginx welcome page, restart the nginx service `sudo docker compose restart nginx`***

---

## Certificates & HTTPS

Both Greenlight and Keycloak should now be accessible through **HTTP** only. However, we do **not recommend** the use of the **HTTP** plain protocol unless it is for **testing purposes**. 

Besides, Keycloak and some browser features on Greenlight are strictly available through **HTTPS**. For the **security** and the **convenience** of the users, *it is recommended to follow the next steps to enable secure HTTPS access to Greenlight.*

To setup the certificates to work with Greenlight, see [Certificates](/greenlight_v3/gl3-certificates.html)

---

## Keycloak & Authentication

In v3, Greenlight offers 3 ways of handling authentication:
1.  Local Accounts 
2.  External Authentication through Keycloak
3.  External Authentication through OpenId

By default, Greenlight ships with Keycloak to provide system administrators an easy way to configure authentication. 

To correctly configure Keycloak with your chosen Identity Provider, see [Configuring Keycloak](/gl3-keycloak.html#connecting-to-keycloak).

To connect to another authentication broker through OpenID, see [Connecting to Another OpenID Provider](/gl3-keycloak.html#connecting-to-another-openid-provider).

If don't plan on using Keycloak, and you would like to completely remove it from your system, see [Removing Keycloak](/gl3-keycloak.html#removing-keycloak).
