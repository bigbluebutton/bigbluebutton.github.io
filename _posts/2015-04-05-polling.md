## Overview

This document outlines the design of the polling in BigBlueButton.  This feature is planned for the next release of BigBlueButton (Fall 2015).

The primary goal of  polling is to enable instructors to increase student engagement during an on-line class.  When an instructor initiates a poll, students should be able to respond quickly.  As the instructor watches the incoming results, they can choose whether or not to publish the results to students.
 
The instructor may ask the students "Is this statement true or false?" or "Do you agree yes or no?" and want to do a quick poll.  Most lectures are structured around a slide deck.  The implementation of polling uses the current slide as the focus for a poll.  For example, consider the following slide.

There are four possible choices: A, B, C, or D.  The instructor should be able to quickly poll students for their response.

### Initiate a Poll
The presenter can initiate a poll at anytime during the lecture.  

To initiate a poll, the presenter clicks the polling button (located to the right of the upload slide button) and chooses from a list of pre-defined questions.

### Respond to a Poll
When the presenter initiates a poll all other users (moderators and viewers) see the possible responses appear as buttons underneath the current slide.

Users respond by clicking on a button corresponding to their choice. Each user can respond once.  Each responses is anonymous.

Earlier designs of polling had a dialog box appear over the slide; however, this obscured the contents of the slide.  By placing the buttons at the bottom, users can focus on the content of the slide before making their response.

### Publish and Annotate a Poll

When the presenter initiates a poll a dialog box will appear showing the results in real-time.  The dialog box is only visible to the presenter.

Click 'Close' will dismiss the results (and prevent any undecided users from responding).

Clicking "Publish' will publish the results into the presentation for everyone to view.

Earlier designs had inserting a new page in the presentation with the poll results; however, this interrupted the flow of the lecture.  By inserting the results into the slide itself, they become part of the lecture.

The results are a whiteboard annotation.  This means, the presenter can zoom into the results, highlight with other whiteboard tools, and clear the results with the '[x]' clear button on the whiteboard toolbar.

A BigBlueButton recording shows all whiteboard annotations, including the inserted poll results.


## Thoughts on the design

Earlier polling designs in BigBlueButton had the instructors enter the poll questions in a dialog box during the lecture.

While we can add that capability in a future update, the above design focuses on quick polling of students by observing that the slide itself can be the context for a poll.

In this regard, the instructor can then seed their presentation with poll-like questions ahead of the lecture and quickly engage students during the lecture with minimal effort.
