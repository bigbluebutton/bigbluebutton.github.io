BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.

The goal of the project is to enable remote students the ability to have a high-quality online learning experience.  A key component of achieving this goal is providing the instructor with tools to engage remote students during a session.  
This document gives you an overview of the features of BigBlueButton. Want to watch a quick overview video of how easy it is to join as a user?  We uploaded [BigBlueButton 2.0 Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeJbK1lvl2I) to YouTube.

# Features

## Modern User Interface

One measure of a successful user interface is how little effort it takes new users to master it.  

While we’ve spent years building and improving features in BigBlueButton, we had not done a comprehensive review of the overall design during that time.  Until now.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, we’ve updated every pixel of the interface with improved skin and high-res icon set.  The overall user interface should now look more coherent and consistent, which gives the user a uniform design language through that enables them to anticipate (and intuit) how functions work.

<img src="/images/Flash-Client.png" alt="flash client interface">

In addition to updated skin and icons, we’ve simplified the dialog boxes so they are easier to navigate.  For example, the new join audio dialog box shows two large icons for easy choice.

<img src="/images/Audio-Modal.png" alt="audio modal">

All icons are now rendered from vectors; they appear crisp even on the highest resolution monitors. 

For consistency, the actions for sharing **audio[1]**, **webcam[2]**, and **desktop[3]** (when you are the presenter) are now grouped together at the top middle of the screen.  The meeting title is on the left, and the **record[4]** button is on the right.

<img src="/images/Flash-Top-Controls.png" alt="top app controls">

We’ve simplified the layout of the Users list by removing the unneeded headers (it's pretty obvious what the icons for headset and microphone mean).

<img src="/images/Flash-UsersList.png" alt="flash userlist">

In addition to improving the overall design, we've added a number of features that have been requested by our community (outlined below).

## WebRTC Audio

Compared with Flash Audio, WebRTC audio uses UDP for transmission and is encoded using OPUS. The browser transmits audio directly to FreeSWITCH. The browser’s acoustic echo cancellation is better than Flash, and both browsers support auto-leveling of that audio, removing the need for the user to manually adjust the sensitivity. WebRTC audio is transmitted securely via SRTP at a rate of 48 Khz, whereas speex is transmitted via RTMP (not encrypted) at a rate of 16 khz.

Overall, WebRTC provides the user a higher quality and lower latency audio transmission. Users have the ability to quickly join the session as a listener, which does not require any permissions from the browser.

## Start/Stop Recording

Moderators can choose the segments of their session that are recorded by clicking the Stop/Start Recording button.

<img src="/images/Flash-Start-Recording.png" alt="start recording">

To help ensure moderators do not forget to start recording their session, BigBlueButton will remind them, after they join the audio bridge, that they can record the meeting.

<img src="/images/Flash-Record-Notification.png" alt="ability to record alert">


## Polling

Polling was designed based on the following user story:

As an instructor I want to easily poll my students to increase their engagement and use the results help teach key concepts.

We focused our efforts on the word ‘easy’. We wanted to make it as easy as possible for the instructor to initiate a poll, see the incoming results live, and publish them for students.

In looking at many lectures, we observed that the current slide provides the context for discussion and, in many cases, the context for a poll-type question. Consider the following slide:

<img src="/images/Flash-Polling-Question.png" alt="polling questions">

It would be natural for the instructor to ask students “What do you think is the answer?” and initiate a poll (ideally using a single click). Polling in BigBlueButton offers three types of interactions:

**Pre-configured choices**, **Smart Polling** and **Custom Choices**

### Pre-configured choices

The presenter can initiate a poll at anytime. To initiate a poll, the presenter clicks the **Polling[1]** button (located in the lower left of the Presentation window) and chooses from a **List[2]** of pre-defined polls.

When the presenter initiates a poll, the Live Results dialog box appears showing the incoming results in real-time. At any point in watching the Live Results, the presenter can **Close[4]** the dialog (this ends the poll) or click **Publish[3]** to close the poll and publish the current results as a whiteboard annotation to the current slide. 

Like any annotation, the presenter can zoom into, further annotate them with the whiteboard tools (maybe call attention to one of the results), and clear the published results with whiteboard ‘x’ clear button. If the user has accessibility options enabled in their operating system, the BigBlueButton client will also publish the polling results to the chat so it can be picked up by a screen reader.

<img src="/images/Flash-Polling-PreConfigure.png" alt="pre-configured poll">

From the user’s perspective, when the presenter initiates a poll they will hear a soft beep and see the **Poll choices[5]** appear under the slide. This way users can still read the contents of the slide and respond with a single click.

<img src="/images/Flash-Poll-Response.png" alt="respond to poll">

When the Live Results dialog is open, the presenter may see ‘12/14’ responses and keep waiting until the remaining two uses respond. However, if they are away from their keyboard they will not. Results can be published with missing responses and will appear in the recordings.

### Smart Polling

Let’s look again at the sample slide.

<img src="/images/Flash-Polling-Question.png" alt="poll questions">

Notice it follows the pattern of a statement followed by options prefixed with ‘A.’, ‘B.’, and ‘C.’. You’ll get the same pattern using PowerPoint, KeyNote, Libre Office, Google Slides, or any presentation software to create an alphabetically numbered outline.

BigBlueButton client recognizes this pattern and, if found, will present the instructor a Smart Poll button with the matching pre-defined choice. This enables the instructor to initiate a poll based on the content in the slide with a single click.

<img src="/images/Flash-Smart-Poll.png" alt="smart poll">

smart poll button gives presenter one-click polling for the current slide.

The BigBlueButton client also scans for the text ‘true/false’ and ‘false/true’ in the slide and, if found, put a Smart Poll button for ‘True/False’.

<img src="/images/Flash-Smart-Poll-TF.png" alt="true/false smart poll">

In a similar manner, it will scan for the text ‘yes/no’ and ‘no/yes’ and, if found, put a Smart Poll button for ‘Yes/No’.

<img src="/images/Flash-Smart-Poll-YN.png" alt="yes/no smart poll">

In this way, the presenter can put a set of polling questions in their slides so during their lecture they can quickly and easily poll the students with a single click per slide.


### Custom Choices

Polling does not require the presenter to upload slides. The presenter can poll the students anytime. The pre-set choices for ‘Yes/No’ are good examples. The presenter can also enter their own polling choices (up to six) for a custom poll.

<img src="/images/Flash-Polling-Custom.png" alt="custom poll">

When the presenter clicks ‘Start Poll’ the range of choices will appear for students underneath the current slide.

<img src="/images/Flash-custom-response.png" alt="custom poll response">

The presenter can watch the incoming Live Results and publish them to the slide.

If a user has the accessibility options enabled in their OS, the BigBlueButton client will also print the poll results to the chat so it can be picked up by a screen reader.

## Emote Icons

Sometimes the instructor may want to ask the class “How is everyone feeling about the lecture?”. The addition of emote icons enables students to raise their hand and give feedback to such questions. Opening the **Emoji List[1]** and selecting a **Status[2]** updates the **Emote icon[3]** to the left of the user’s name in the Users window.

<img src="/images/Flash-Set-Emoji.png" alt="set emoji status">

## Screen Sharing

When the presenter launches screen sharing, the BigBlueButton client will download a Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) file called screenshare.jnlp that, when opened, will download a Java application and run the screen sharing outside the browser.

By running outside the browser, screen sharing works on all browsers.

### Starting Screen Sharing

To start screen sharing, the presenter clicks the **screen sharing[1]** icon in the toolbar. Options are presented to the user for selecting the prefered method of screen share via **WebRTC[2]** or **Java[3]**. 

<img src="/images/Flash-Open-ScreenShare.png" alt="open screenshare options">

#### WebRTC Screen Sharing

Support is implimented for the BigBlueButton Flash client to use the built-in WebRTC capabilities of the browser (in FireFox and Chrome) to share the stream.  Using the built-in capabilities does not require externally launching to Java.

To enable WebRTC screen sharing, edit `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` and change

~~~
offerWebRTC="false"
~~~

to 

~~~
offerWebRTC="true"
~~~

When WebRTC screen sharing is enabled, and when a presenter uses FireFox or Chrome, they will have an option of using WebRTC to share their screen.  

<img src="/images/20-screenshare-choice.png" alt="screenshare choice">

When choosing WebRTC on Chrome, the presenter will be giving a dialog to select which screen to share in a floating window.

<img src="/images/20-chrome-select.png" alt="screenshare chrome">

When choosing WebRTC on FireFox, the presenter will be giving a dialog to select which screen to share from a drop-down menu.

<img src="/images/20-firefox-select.png" alt="screenshare firefox">

When WebRTC screen sharing starts, both the presenter and viewers will see the presenter's screen.  As with Java-based screen sharing, the presenter will see a small preview window of what the viewers are seeing.


#### Java Screen Sharing

The Java option displays a set of images that guide the user through starting the screen sharing. These images are specific to the user’s combination of operating system and browser.

<img src="/images/Flash-SS-Java.png" alt="screenshare java instructions">

When the user clicks ‘Start’, BigBlueButton will download screenshare.jnlp. The file may be called screenshare(1).jnlp, screenshare(2).jnlp, etc. depending on previous downloads.

Following the steps shown in the window, the instructor can opens screenshare.jnlp, which causes Java to launch and download and run BigBlueButton Screenshare. Java will display certificate confirmation dialog requesting permissions to run BigBlueButton Screenshare.

<img src="/images/Java-run-confirm.png" alt="java confirm">

Once running, the Desktop Sharing Presenters Preview window shows a thumbnail video of what students are currently seeing. This thumbnail is not resizable (students see the desktop in a resizable window).

The presenter can pause/resume the desktop sharing stream. Clicking ‘Close’ will stop the desktop sharing.

##### Sharing a Region

On Windows and Linux, the presenter has the option of sharing a region. When choosing region, the presenter will see a dashed outline of the desktop sharing area when BigBlueButton Screenshare runs.

<img src="/images/Flash-SS-Region.png" alt="select screenshare region">

Clicking ‘Start Sharing’ will start sharing the selected region. As with sharing full screen, a thumbnail version of what the remote students see will appear in the Desktop Sharing Presenter’s Preview window.

Due to the limitation of underlying components in the new screen sharing, there is no option on Mac OS X to share a region – it will only capture full-screen of the first monitor.


## Closed Captioning

BigBlueButton now supports live captioning during a session - a moderator (such as a stenographer) can enter captions for a selected language during the class and BigBlueButton will display those captions, in real-time, to other students. After the session is finished, the captions will appear as subtitles in the recordings.

### Creating Captions

A moderator first selects Closed Caption layout.

<img src="/images/Flash-CC-Layout.png" alt="select captions layout">

and then selects the language to provide captions

<img src="/images/Flash-CC-Lang.png" alt="select captions language">

and then selects the first tab (it will have the name of the selected language). Once selected, the moderator clicks Take Ownership (this ensures only one moderator at a time is entering captions for the given language). At this point, the moderator can begin typing text (or using a stenograph machine to inject text) into the tet area.

<img src="/images/Flash-CC-Ownership.png" alt="take captions ownership">

### View Live Captions

When a viewer (student) selects the Closed Captioning layout, The Closed Captioning dialog will display the active language streams.

<img src="/images/Flash-CC-Viewer.png" alt="captions viewer perspective">

Clicking a language opens a new tab. Clicking on the first tab shows the live captions as they are typed.

<img src="/images/Flash-CC-Live.png" alt="live captions example">

### Viewing captions in Playback

Later, when viewing the recording, the playback bar will have a ‘CC’ button. Clicking on the ‘CC’ button will show the available captions.

<img src="/images/ClosedCaption-Playback.png" alt="recorded captions playback">

## Breakout Rooms

Any moderator (usually the instructor) can now place students into breakout rooms, monitor their interaction, and end the breakout rooms at any time.

Breakout rooms are full BigBlueButton sessions. The ability to record breakout rooms is under development. Each student in a breakout room has moderator role, which means any student can make themselves presenter and upload a presentation for sharing with other students.

To start a breakout room, choose **Breakout Rooms[2]** from the **Gear icon[1]**.

<img src="/images/Flash-BR-Start.png" alt="starting breakout room">

### Configure Breakout Rooms

When you choose “Breakout Rooms …” the following dialog box appears.

The Breakout Room dialog enables the instructor to specify

1. the number of breakout rooms: 2,3,4, or 5
2. time limit
3. enable users to select their own room
4. drag and drop users between rooms
5. which users should not be placed into breakout room (the “Not Assigned” room)

<img src="/images/Flash-BR-Configure.png" alt="configure breakout room">

### Student Joining a Breakout Room

When the moderator presses the ‘Start’ button in the Breakout Room dialog, any user assigned to a breakout room will see the following dialog inviting them to join the breakout room.

<img src="/images/Flash-Join-BR.png" alt="join breakoutroom">

If users receive an invitation where they are permitted to choose any available room, a drop-down menu to select a specific room to join will appear.

<img src="/images/Join-BreakoutRoom.png" alt="choose breakoutroom">

Clicking Join Session causes the breakout room session to open in a new tab. The user remains joined in the main session (where they can chat with the instructor and ask questions). BigBlueButton will disconnect drop them from the audio from the main room. This will prevent students from being joined into two different audio sessions at the same time.

The breakout room will have a countdown timer about the chat to inform the users of the **Remaining Time[1]**. Once the timer reaches 0, the breakout room will automatically close. Users can return to the previous tab and rejoin the audio in the main room.

<img src="/images/Flash-BR-Time.png" alt="breakoutroom timer">

### Monitoring Breakout Rooms

When the instructor clicks ‘Start’ in the Breakout Room dialog, a breakout room status table will appear in the Users window. The instructor can **Join[1]** the breakout room in a new tab, or **Close[2]** the breakout rooms early (before the time remaining expires).

<img src="/images/Flash-Monitor-Breakout.png" alt="monitor breakoutrooms">

## Enabled Presentation Download

The presenter can now give students the ability to download a presentation.

When uploading a presentation, the presenter can click the **Upload Presentation[1]** button then check **Enable download of presentation[2]**.

<img src="/images/Flash-UploadFiles.png" alt="enable presentation download">

If this option is checked, a download button will appear in the Presentation area, for each user in the session. Later on, a user can click **Download Presentation[1]**, BigBlueButton will display a dialog giving the user the ability to download any presentation that was enabled for **Download[2]**. 

<img src="/images/Flash-Download-Pres.png" alt="download presentation">

## Pen Tool Smoothing

BigBlueButton smooths all strokes of the pen tool.  When drawing with the pen you'll see it work as before, but when you release the mouse, BigBlueButton will smooth the lines a bit.

<img src="/images/Flash-Line-Smoothing.png" alt="line smoothing">

This smoothing makes math equations and diagrams a bit easier to read for students.

## Promote Viewer to Moderator

Moderators have the ability to promote any viewer to the role of moderator or demote any moderator to the viewer role.  To promote a viewer, click the **Gear icon[1]** icon to the right of a user’s name and choose **Promote[2]**.

Later on, any moderator can demote the same user back to a viewer by choosing the **Demote[3]** option from inside the gear icon menu.

<img src="/images/Flash-Promote.png" alt="promote user"> <img src="/images/Flash-Demote.png" alt="demote user"> 

## Viewer permissions

The moderator now has the ability to lock (restrict) viewers from having the following abilities:

Webcam, Microphone, Public Chat, Private Chat and Layout

The following diagram illustraits an example of a moderator locking the private chat for all viewers:

Select the **Gear icon[1]** at the bottom of the users list, then the **Lock Viewers[2]** option. With the Lock modal open, check **Private Chat[3]** and then **Apply[4]**

<img src="/images/Flash-Lock-Viewers.png" alt="lock viewer features"> 

## Download Public Chat Messages

In BigBlueButton 2.0, the Options tab provides users a button for **Copying Public Chat[2]** messages to the clipboard (which makes the function more accessible for users with screen readers).

Next to the copy button there are two others buttons

   * **Download the public chat[1]** as plain text
   * **Delete public chat[3]** (moderator only)

<img src="/images/Flash-Chat-Options.png" alt="chat options"> 

## End Meeting on Logout

Ever wanted to end the meeting and kick out all users.  Now, when anyone who is moderator logs out, they will have the option to immediately end the session.

Selecting **Yes and end meeting[1]** will cause BigBlueButton to immediately end the session, which in turn kicks out all other users and initiates the processing of the recording (if the meeting was set to be recorded).

<img src="/images/Flash-End-Meeting.png" alt="end meeting"> 

## Full Screen Mode

Users can now have BigBlueButton take the entire screen with the **Full Screen[1]** button.

Clicking this button causes BigBlueButton to take over the full screen (this invokes the browser's built-in full screen capability). 

<img src="/images/Flash-fullscreenBtn.png" alt="full screen"> 

When users click the Full Screen button, the browser displays a confirmation dialog on the switch to full screen mode.

<img src="/images/Chrome-FullScreen-Confirm.png" alt="exit full screen"> 

Users can exit full screen mode anytime by pressing the **[ESC]** key.

## Shared Notes

Active learning is more effective than passively watching a lecture. Engaging students to recall and apply what they just learned re-enforces new concepts and ideas. Breakout rooms are an example of having students engage in discussion.

A new layout called “Shared Notes”, gives students a collaborative note pad for capturing content during the session. Shared notes are made visible by selecting the **Shared Notes[2]** layout from the **Layout Dropdown[1]**.

When choosing this layout, the **Shared Notes window[3]** appears on the left-hand side.  Any user can write/edit in the window at the same time.

<img src="/images/Flash-Show-SharedNotes.png" alt="show shared notes"> 

Think of them as a collaborative notepad during the live session.  Shared notes are not saved as part of the recording.

Any moderator can clear the shared notes using the **Clear this note[5]** option in the **gear icon[4]** (this icon is only visible to moderators).

<img src="/images/Flash-Clear-SharedNotes.png" alt="clear shared notes"> 

### Multiple Shared Notes

A moderator can launch (up to) two additional shared notes windows. Clicking on the **Gear icon[1]**, then selecting **Create[2]** menu option opens a new window called “Note name”, here the moderator can **Name[3]** the new shared note.

<img src="/images/Flash-Create-SharedNote.png" alt="create shared notes">

The two additional windows will be visible across layouts.

### Text Formatting

The Shared Notes window allows users to apply formatting changes (font, font size, and style) to any of the text in the shared notes.

<img src="/images/Flash-SharedNotes-TextFormat.png" alt="format shared notes">

### Download Shared Notes

Users can also download the content of the shared notes as plain text or HTML.

<img src="/images/Flash-SharedNotes-TextFormat.png" alt="download shared notes">

The download option lets users save the shared notes for later use.  As stated above, shared notes are not saved as part of the recording - they are cleared from memory when the meeting ends.

## Multi-user Whiteboard

BigBlueButton supports multiple users updating the whiteboard in real-time.  This enables a tutor, for example, to collaboratively work together with a student on a math problem.

To enable/disable multi-user whiteboard, the presenter clicks the **Multi-User[1]** Whiteboard button on the toolbar.

When engaged, all users can annotate the current slide.  The User’s names will appear to the right of their cursor as illustraited in the image below.

Users can only clear their own whiteboard marks by clicking the **X[2]** button.  

If the presenter clicks the **X[2]** button when multi-user whiteboard is turned off, BigBlueButton will clear all marks by all users.

The recording format for BigBlueButton allows for record and playback of all multi-user whiteboard annotations.

<img src="/images/Flash-Multi-Whiteboard.png" alt="multiuser whiteboard btn">

## HTML5 client

Built upon the 2.0 release, the HTML5 client let's viewers participate in BigBlueButton sessions from mobile devices.  For more information see [HTML5 Client](/html/html5-overview.html) along with installation instructions.

You can configure BigBlueButton 2.0-beta to only load the HTML5 client by editing `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties` and set the following two parameters to `true`.

~~~
# Force all attendees to join the meeting using the HTML5 client
attendeesJoinViaHTML5Client=true

# Force all moderators to join the meeting using the HTML5 client
moderatorsJoinViaHTML5Client=true
~~~

After making the edit, do `sudo bbb-conf --restart` to reload the settings.  Any front-end using BigBlueButton will automatically launch the HTML5 client on desktop and mobile.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Miscellaneous

## API

### getMeetings

The `getMeetings` API call now returns a union of the previous `getMeetings` and `getMeetingInfo` in a single API call.  

In BigBlueButton version 1.1, if you wanted to get a snapshot of all meeting and user activity on your server, you needed to do a `getMeetings` API call and then iterate through each meeting and do a `getMeetingsInfo` API call. 

In BigBlueButton 2.0, you can now do a single `getMeetings` API call to get all the data in one call.

Here is a `getMeetings` call with one active meeting with two uers.

~~~xml

</response>

## Reduced reconnect time

We've refactored some of the code to reconnect the client when one of the RTMP connections drop.  Instead of waiting 10 seconds it will now wait 2 seconds.  This parameter is configurable by editing `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml` and setting the value for `reconnWaitTime`.

~~~xml
    <application uri="rtmp://s77-good.freddixon.ca/bigbluebutton" host="https://s77-good.freddixon.ca/bigbluebutton/api/enter" reconnWaitTime="2000"/>
~~~

This change reduces the pause in the client when a reconnect occurs.


## defaultMaxUsers

In previous versions, the value for `defaultMaxUsers` in `bigbluebutton.properties` (located in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.propreties`) was not used.  

~~~
# Default maximum number of users a meeting can have.
# Current default is 0 (meeting doesn't have a user limit).
defaultMaxUsers=0
~~~

In BigBlueButton 2.0 the server will enforce the value and, if the maximum limit is reached, redirect the user to the following URL 

~~~
   https://IP_or_HOSTNAME/?errors=[{"message":"The number of participants allowed for this meeting has been reached.","key":"maxParticipantsReached"}]
~~~

A value of `defaultMaxUsers=0` means the server will not enforce the limit.

## Refactoring of messages

In BigBlueButton 2.0 we have refactored the messaging format used to communicate between the different server components and between the client and server. The goal of this was to streamline the creation and processing of messages which in previous versions required a lot of steps. The end result is a much easier system to work with that allows for quicker edits and additions. 

## More efficient processing of recordings

BigBlueButton 1.1, there was one thread that would archive all recordings, then process them, then publish them.  If there were many recordings to process, they would all need to finish processing (which could take many hours) before any would publish.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, the archive, process, and publish steps for creating a published recording now occur in parallel.  This means there are three threads now, one for each step, and they execute in parallel.  

## Branding

We've made it easier to brand your BigBlueButton 2.0 client. You can now change the **Logo[1]** and **Copyright[2]** text 

<img src="/images/Flash-Branding.png" alt="client logo">

by modifying the `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/conf/config.xml`.  To modify, edit this file and look for the XML tag `branding`.

~~~xml
<branding logo="logo.swf" copyright="&#169; 2017 &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigbluebutton.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.bigbluebutton.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (build {0})" background="bbb_logo.png" toolbarColor="#F0F2F6" showQuote="true"/>
~~~

You can change the parameters:

  * `logo` : The logo file name. It will be displayed in the higher left-hand corner. JPEG, PNG, BMP and SWF files are accepted. The recommended maximum height is 35 pixels. Default location is `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client/logo.swf`
  * `copyright` : The copyright mention that will be displayed in the lower left-hand corner of the footer. It accepts HTML but should be HTML-encoded. The `{0}` token will be replaced by the build number when the application is launched.
  * `background` : The background image name. It will be displayed behind the windows. JPEG, PNG, BMP and SWF files are accepted.
  * `toolbarColor` : The background colour of the top toolbar. Must be an hexadecimal value that starts with a `#`.

## Gather User Feedback

We've expanded the logout dialog to solicit feedback from the user on their experience.  The user can rate the experience from 1 to 5 **Stars[1]** (similar to an Amazon rating). When clicked, a **Dialog Box[2]** appears asking if there is anything specific that could be improved. Feedback is submitted after selecting the **OK[3]** button.

<img src="/images/Flash-Feedback.png" alt="application feedback">

You can enable the display of the feedback dialog by setting askForFeedbackOnLogout to `true`

~~~
  askForFeedbackOnLogout="true"
~~~

The responses to the feedback are sent to the BigBlueButton server via the [client logging](/overview/overview.html#client-logging)

A sample entry in the client log comes in with escaped characters.

## Webcams only visible to moderators

There are occasions where the moderator does not want viewers to see each other's webcams.  A case might be that the students are all in the same classroom and sharing their webcams.  If there were 10 students sharing webcams, it would be 10 outgoing video streams to the BigBlueButton server and 90 incoming video streams to the same classroom.  

There is an option in the lock settings to lock the **Viewer's Webcams[1]** so they are only visible to moderators.

## Limit moderator actions in breakout rooms

All users in a breakout room join as moderators.  To make remove unintended results for K12 users, removed two moderator capabilities: demoting others to viewers and kicking out other users.  

Also added the ability to restrict private chat in breakout rooms by setting `privateChateEnabled` to `true` in `config.xml`.

~~~
    <breakoutRooms enabled="true" record="false" privateChateEnabled="true"/>
~~~

## Locked private chat does not prevent chatting with moderators

When a moderator locks down the ability for viewers to private chat with each other, they can still engage in private chat with the moderator.  Usually the only moderator in a room is the teacher, so this means that students can still do private chat with the teacher when private chat is locked down.

## Start all sessions with multi-user whiteboard enabled

There is now a `multiUserDefault` configuration option in `/usr/share/bbb-apps-akka/conf/application.conf` to enable you to set multi-user whiteboard by default for all sessions.  

~~~
whiteboard {
  multiUserDefault = true
}
~~~

The default value is `false`.
