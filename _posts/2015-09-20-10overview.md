# BigBlueButton 1.0-Beta

This document covers the new capabilities in BigBlueButton 1.0-Beta (referred hereafter as simply BigBlueButton 1.0).

The goal of this release is to increase interactivity between the teacher and students with three new features:

  * Polling (see [1586](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/1586))
  * Improved Video Doc (see [2790](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/2790))
  * Emote Icons (see [2791](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/2791))
  * Puffin Browser detection

As with every release, we've refactored components to improve stability:

  * Refactoring of message passing bbb-apps (see [2684](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/2684))
  * Automatic reconnect of client (see [1634](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/1634))

We've added enhancements for developers/administrators as well, which include

  * Deskshare TLS over Stunnel (see [2792](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/2792))
  * API Updates (see [2793](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/issues/2793))
  * WebHooks

We've also updated the build scripts to work with servers that have [HTTPS installed](/install/install.html#configuring-https-on-bigbluebutton).

For those of you who have followed the project for a while you may be thinking "The dev team is actually going to release 1.0."  Yes, we are.  In some ways, it's a bit anticlimactic.  There have been so many production deployments of BigBlueButton in recent years that suggests the version number should be much higher.  Some companies have been running BigBlueButton in production since 2009.  Also, we want to move to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) as it's easier for the community to better follow how the product changes between releases.  

Welcome to BigBlueButton 1.0.  We hope you enjoy this release.


# Features

## Polling

We designed polling based on the following user story:

  _As an instructor I want to easily poll my students to increase their engagement and use the results help teach key concepts._

We focused our efforts on the word 'easy'.  We wanted to make easy for the instructor to initiate a poll, see the incoming results live, and publish them for students. 

In looking at many lectures, we observed that the current slide provides the context for discussion and, in many cases, the context for a poll-type question.  Consider the following slide:

![Context](/images/polling-context.png)

It would be natural for the instructor to ask students "What do you think is the answer?" and initiate a poll (ideally using a single click).  Polling in BigBlueButton offers three types of interactions:

   1. Pre-configured choices
   1. Smart Polling
   1. Custom Choices

### Pre-configured choices

The presenter can initiate a poll at anytime.  To initiate a poll, the presenter clicks the polling button (located in the lower left of the Presentation window) and chooses from a list of pre-defined questions.

![Pre-defined](/images/polling-pop-up.png)

When the presenter initiates a poll, the Live Results dialog box appears showing the incoming results in real-time.

![Live Results](/images/polling-live-results.png)

At any point in watching the Live Results, the presenter can close the dialog (this ends the poll) or click 'Publish' to close the poll and publish the current results as a whiteboard annotation to the current slide. 

![Publish](/images/polling-publish.png)

Like any annotation, the presenter can zoom into, further annotate them with the whiteboard tools (maybe call attention to one of the results), and clear the published results  with whiteboard 'x' clear button.  If the user has accessibility options enabled in their operating system, the BigBlueButton client will also publish the polling results to the chat so it can be picked up by a screen reader.

From the user's perspective, when the presenter initiates a poll they will hear a soft beep and see the poll choices appear under the slide.  

![Response](/images/polling-response.png)

This way users can still read the contents of the slide and respond with a single click.  

Polling is anonymous.  When the Live Results dialog is open, the presenter may see '12/14' responses and keep waiting until the remaining two uses respond.  However, if they are away from their keyboard they will not.  If the presenter wanted to identify which users are at their keyboard, they could ask all students to raise their had, which is not anonymous.  The two users who do not raise their hand are away from the keyboard.

Any published poll results will appear in the recordings.

![Response](/images/polling-recording.png)

### Smart Polling

Let's look again at the sample slide.  

![Context](/images/polling-context.png)

Notice it follows the pattern of a statement followed by options prefixed with 'A.', 'B.', and 'C.'.  You'll get the same pattern using PowerPoint, KeyNote, Libre Office, Google Slides, or any presentation software to create an alphabetically numbered outline.  

BigBlueButton client recognizes this pattern and, if found, will present the instructor a _Smart Poll_ button with the matching pre-defined choice.  This enables the instructor to initiate a poll based on the content in the slide with a single click.

![Response](/images/polling-smart-poll.png)

The BigBlueButton client also scans for the text 'true/false' and 'false/true' in the slide and, if found, put a Smart Poll button for 'True/False'.

![Response](/images/polling-true-false.png)

In a similar manner, it will scan for the text 'yes/no' and 'no/yes' and, if found, put a Smart Poll button for 'Yes/No'.

![Response](/images/polling-yes-no.png)

In this way, the presenter can put a set of polling questions in their slides so during their lecture they can quickly and easily poll the students with a single click per slide.

### Custom Choices

Polling does not require the presenter to upload slides.  The presenter can poll the students anytime.  The pre-set choices for 'Yes/No' are good examples.  The presenter can also enter their own polling choices (up to six) for a custom poll.  

![Custom Choices](/images/polling-enter-custom.png)

Just as before, when the presenter clicks 'Start Poll' the range of choices will appear for students underneath the current slide.

![Custom Choices](/images/polling-custom-response.png)

As before, the presenter can watch the incoming Live Results and publish them to the slide.  

If a user has the accessibility options enabled in their OS, the BigBlueButton client will also print the poll results to the chat so it can be picked up by a screen reader.

![Accessible Poll Results](/images/polling-accessible-results.png)

## Improved Video Dock

We removed the borders from the webcam videos so to give the maximum amount of space to the videos.  Here's an example of four webcams

![Webcam 1](/images/10-video-dock-1.png)

The videos will flow to make the maximum use of space.  Here's how the videos flow into a horizontal window.

![Webcam 2](/images/10-video-dock-2.png)

Here are eight webcams being shared and one has been clicked on to make it larger than others.

![Webcam 3](/images/10-video-dock-3.png)

When the user shares their video, the resolution options seen in the drop-down menu are now defined in a separate configuration file [profiles.xml](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/bigbluebutton-client/resources/prod/profiles.xml).

## Emote Icons

Sometimes the instructor may want to ask the class "How is everyone feeling about the lecture?".  The addition of emote icons enables students to raise their hand and give feedback to such questions.

![Emote Icons](/images/10-emote-icons.png)

The emote icons appear to the left of the user's name in the Users window.

![Emote Icons](/images/10-emote-icons-2.png)

## Support for Puffin browser

[Puffin Browser](https://www.puffinbrowser.com/index.php) supports the latest Flash Engine over the cloud for iPad, iPhone and Android devices.  Puffin browser version 4.6 (and later) enables the user to broadcast their webcam and microphone within their iOS device in BigBlueButton.

The following is a screen shot of BigBlueButton running on an iPad using the Puffin Browser.

# Stability Improvements

## Refactoring of BigBlueButton apps

We've extracted the core messaging in red5 into two external servers.  The messaging for bbb-apps now goes through `bbb-akka-apps` and the messaging for FreeSWITCH using the Event Socket Layer now goes through `bbb-akka-fsesl`.  

[Akka](http://akka.io/) is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the Java Virtual Machine.  Using Akka simplified the design of the messaging passing and also exposed all the messages in a session via redis (using pub/sub) integration with other systems.  

## Automatic reconnect of the client

The BigBlueButton client now detects if one of its media connections (i.e. video) drops when the user is connected.  If it detects a drop, it will automatically reconnect the user.  

![Reconnecting](/images/10-reconnecting.png)

This is similar to Skype's dialog indicating it is reconnecting a user due to network interruption.  

If the user is connected to audio using WebRTC (which is the default audio for FireFox and Chrome), it may stay connected as it uses UDP, in which case the user can still talk with the class while the client automatically reconnects.

### getRecordings

We added a meta parameter to the `getRecordings` API call to filter recordings.

Parameters:

| Change | Param Name | When Returned | Type | Description |
|:------:|:----------:|:-------------:|:----:|:------------|
| Added | meta | Optional | String | You can pass one or more metadata values to filter the recordings returned. The format of these parameters is the same as the metadata passed to the `create` call. For more information see [the docs for the create call](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/dev/api.html#create). |

Example Requests:

```bash
http://yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/getRecordings?meta_presenter=joe&meta_category=education&checksum=1234
```

## Webhooks

For details see [Webhooks](/1.0/webhooks.html) document.

# Miscellaneous

## Updated FreeSWITCH

We upgraded the version of FreeSWITCH to 1.4.21.  This brings in the latest improvements FreeSWITCH has made to supporting WebRTC audio.

## Disable audible notification for new chat message

BigBlueButton now gives the user an option to enable/disable the new chat notification sounds the 'Options' tab in the Chat window.
