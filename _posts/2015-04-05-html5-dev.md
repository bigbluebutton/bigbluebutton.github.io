# HTML5 Development Environment Setup

This document covers the setup of a development environment for the BigBlueButton HTML5 client.

If you have not already done so, read through the [Overview of HTML5 Client](/html/html5-overview.html)

## Initial setup

Before you begin, you need [install the HTML5 client](/html/html5-install.html) on a BigBlueButton 2.0 (or later) server.

### Have a GitHub Account

You need a GitHub account.  Also, you need to be very familiar with how git works.  Specifically, you need to know how to

  * clone a repository
  * create a branch
  * push changes back to a repository

If you have not used git before, or if the terms **_clone_**, **_branch_**, and **_commit_** are unfamiliar to you, stop now.  These are fundamental concepts to git that you need to become competent with before trying to develop on BigBlueButton. To become competent, a good place to start is this [free book](http://git-scm.com/book) and [GitHub Help pages](http://help.github.com/).

Using GitHub makes it easy for you to work on your own copy of the BigBlueButton source, store your updates to the source to your GitHub account, and make it easy for you to [contribute to BigBlueButton](/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

### Subscribe to bigbluebutton-dev

We recommend you subscribe to the [bigbluebutton-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2) mailing list to follow updates to the development of BigBlueButton and to collaborate with other developers.


## Checking out the Source

The steps below assume you have cloned the BigBlueButton repository in the following directory (your home directory will likely be different than `firstuser`).

~~~
/home/firstuser/dev
~~~

Using your GitHub account, do the following

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the BigBlueButton repository into your GitHub account.
2. Clone your repository into your `~/dev` folder.

Note that you need just the `v2.0.x-release` branch.

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/bigbluebutton.git
~~~

After cloning, you'll have the following directory (make sure the `bigbluebutton` directory is within your `dev` directory).

~~~
/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton
~~~

Next, checkout the `v2.0.x-release` branch.

~~~
git fetch origin
git checkout v2.0.x-release

~~~

Confirm that you are working on the `v2.0.x-release` branch.

~~~
$ cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton
$ git status
~~~

You should see

~~~
# On branch v2.0.x-release
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
~~~

## Setup of the development environment 

First, shut down the packaged version of the HTML5 client so you are not running two copies in parallel.

~~~
$ sudo service bbb-html5 stop
~~~

### Nginx configuration:

If you do not have `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/bbb-html5.nginx`, please create it and make sure it contains the following:

~~~
location /html5client {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
}

location /_timesync {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
}
~~~

Save the file. Reload:

~~~
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
~~~

Test the nginx configuration

~~~
$ sudo nginx -t
~~~
If the output from the above command contains errors check again the nginx configuration you just edited.

### curl

You will need to download some files throughout these instructions using curl. If it is not installed on your server, you can install the package using the following command

~~~
$ sudo apt-get install curl
~~~

### NodeJS

You need to install the 8.x version of nodejs:

~~~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
~~~

### Meteor.js

You will need to install [Meteor.js](http://www.meteor.com).

~~~
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
~~~

### Configurations
You want to modify `bigbluebutton.properties` so that SVG images for the HTML5 client's presentation are generated by default.

~~~
$ sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties
~~~

Set the field `svgImagesRequired` to true. Then restart tomcat7.

~~~
$ sudo service tomcat7 restart
~~~

### Running
Assuming that you cloned the repository in `/home/firstuser/dev`, navigate to

~~~
$ cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5/
~~~  

Install the npm dependencies

~~~
meteor npm install
~~~

In order to run the server side of the HTML5 client you will need to execute the following:

~~~
$ npm start
~~~

By default, the client will run in `development` mode. Loading into production environment can be done by passing the value of `NODE_ENV`:

~~~
$ NODE_ENV=production npm start
~~~

Wait until the process starts and confirm that the configuration is valid by navigating to

~~~
http://<your_ip>/html5client/check
~~~

The result should be `{"html5clientStatus":"running"}`.

### Usage

There are several ways to join a meeting using the HTML5 client:

#### Attempt joining on a device which does not have Flash
If you visit a link (to a BigBlueButton meeting) on your Android/iOS device you will automatically be using the HTML5 client. The same goes for opening the link with a desktop browser if Flash has been disabled.

#### Starting from a demo page
Make sure you have the demos package installed: `sudo apt install bbb-demos`.  Go to `http://<your_ip>/` in the browser. Select "API examples". Navigate to “HTML5 Client Demo” and use the form. You will enter a meeting titled "Demo Meeting".

#### Pass parameter on joining 
Pass `joinViaHtml5=true` as a parameter and you will be navigating into the meeting using the HTML5 client.

#### Configure the server to prefer HTML5 for some/all users
You can modify `bigbluebutton.properties` so that all attendees or all moderators (or everyone) joins via HTML5. For this set `attendeesJoinViaHTML5Client` or `moderatorsJoinViaHTML5Client` to true and restart BigBlueButton.

### Serve the client over HTTPS
Make sure you follow the instructions for [configuring https on BigBlueButton](/install/install.html#configuring-https-on-bigbluebutton). Test your server using the Flash client. Make sure the audio works and the slides display properly.
The HTML5 client does not require any additional configuration to run over https. If the rest of BigBlueButton is running fine as https, you are set!

## Localization with Transifex

We use Transifex for crowdsourcing for BigBlueButton Internationalization(i18n). The following steps are not a part of the typical installation and are only required for bringing the language strings in github up to date. There are two ways to pull the translation files; using the transifex.sh script or the transifex client.

### Using transifex.sh

The transifex.sh script aims to make retrieving translation files on the Transifex servers as simple as possible. In order to use the script, you must provide your Transifex credentials which have the appropriate authorization. The script can be used in the following ways.

~~~
$ ./transifex.sh all
~~~

Using the all argument will tell the script to download all available translation files.

~~~
$ ./transifex.sh fr de pt-BR
~~~

If you only need a specific set of translations, the script can be run with the required locales as argument.


## Setup & Configure Transifex Client

This is an alternative method to using the transifex.sh and is essentially the manual process for retrieving translation files from the Transifex servers.

### 1. Install Transifex Client ###

To installation the Transifex client we use pip, a package management system designed to manage and install Python packages.

~~~
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
~~~

Next we use Pip to install the Transifex client.

~~~
$ sudo pip install transifex-client
~~~

The following command is used to upgrade the client to the most current version.

~~~
$ pip install --upgrade transifex-client
~~~

### 2. Transifex Project Initialization ###

The `tx init` command is used to initialize a project. Run from the root directory of the application.

~~~
$ tx init
Creating .tx folder. . .
Transifex instance [https://www.transifex.com]:
~~~

Press Enter (will be prompted for your Transifex username and password)

~~~
Creating skeleton...
Creating config file...
​Done.
~~~

This will create a Transifex project file in the current directory containing the project’s configuration file.


### 3. Transifex Client configuration ###
#### .tx/config ####

The Transifex client uses a per project configuration file. This is located in .tx/config of your project's root directory and is generated on running the `tx init` command. It should be updated with the following configuration:

~~~
[main]
host = https://www.transifex.com

[bigbluebutton-html5.enjson]
file_filter = private/locales/<lang>.json
source_file = private/locales/en_US.json
source_lang = en_US
type = KEYVALUEJSON
~~~


### 4. Set a Project Remote ###

`tx set` allows you to configure and edit Transifex project files on your local computer.

The following command is used to initialize a local project for the remote project specified by the URL.

`$ tx set --auto-remote https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bigbluebutton-html5/resources/enjson/`

Next we can pull language files located on the Transifex server.


### 5. Pull: Download Transifex Translations ###

To pull all translation files from the Transifex server, the following command is used.

`$ tx pull -a bigbluebutton-html5.enjson`

In the event that there are a lot of translations, instead of pulling all, we can specify which translations we want to acquire.

`$ tx pull -r bigbluebutton-html5.enjson -l pt_BR`

Alternatively, simply download a ZIP archive of all languages in the project from the Transifex project page and unarchive it in the `private/locales/` directory.

## Accessibility

### Overview

In order to accommodate all of the users who may have one or a combination of impairments, we refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. This document outlines the standards expected to be included, where applicable, with all HTML markup on the web.

When dealing with web accessibility there are a few key factors we must keep in mind while developing

  1. Tab Order
  2. Color Contrast
  3. Focus
  4. Semantics
  5. Testing

### Tab Order

The goal when implementing the tab order is ensuring the elements in the  tab sequence are logical and simple.

When a user presses the tab key focus should move to the next interactable element. If the user continues to press the tab key, focus should move in a logical order through all the interactable elements on the page. The tab focus should be visually identified, currently the HTML5 client adds a thin border to the field, when tab is pressed focus is seen to visibly move.

***Note: A number of users including the following.***

  * ***Those with visual impairments, who rely on screen readers or screen magnifiers.***
  * ***Those with limited dexterity, who depend on the use of the keyboard to using a mouse.***
  * ***Those who can only utilize a single switch to control a computer.***

***will all navigate through a page by using the tab button.***


The order of elements in the DOM determine their place in the tab order, for elements that should receive focus. Elements that don’t natively receive focus can be inserted into the tab order by adding a tabindex=”0” property.

***Caution:***
***When using the tabindex property, positive values should generally be avoided because it places elements outside of the natural tab order, this can present issues for screen reader users who rely on navigating the DOM through a linear manner.***

The following extension gives a visual representation of the tab order of a current web document.

### Focus


### Color Contrast

When dealing with color contrast we are talking about finding colors for a scheme that not only implement maximum contrast, but gives the appropriate contrast between the content and its background for those who experience low visual impairments, color deficiencies or the loss of contrast typically accompanied by aging.

The HTML5 client ensures that all visual designs meet the minimum color-contrast ratio for both normal as well as large text on a background, described by the WCAG 2.0 AA standards.  “Contrast (Minimum): Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3.” 

To make sure that we have met these guidelines, there are numerous tools available online which allow the comparison of foreground and background colors using hex values, to see if they fall within the appropriate contrast ratio.

![Contrast Ratio Calculator](/images/accessibility_colorchecker.jpg)
http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/


#### Currently implemented colors:

![Currently implemented element colors](/images/accessibility_colors1.jpg)
![Currently implemented typography colors](/images/accessibility_colors2.jpg)
 
* Blue - primary color - action buttons
* Red - closing audio, indicators and error alerts
* Green - audio indicator, success alert, check marks
* Orange - warning alerts
* Dark Blue - Headings
* Grey - base typography color


***Note:***
***The ChromeLense extension also provides the ability to view your browser using different personas of users who may view web content with various different visual impairments. This is particularly useful when deciding on appropriate color schemes to best suit a wider range of users.***


### Semantics

Users with visual disabilities can miss out on visual affordances. We need to make sure the information we are trying to express, is expressed in a way that flexible enough so assistive technology can pick up on it; creating an alternative interface for our users. we refer to this as expressing the semantics of an element.

The HTML5 client uses the WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to provide access to screen readers. The following list of commonly used aria attributes:

  * aria-role
  * aria-label
  * aria-labelledby
  * aria-describedby
  * aria-hidden
  * aria-live
  * aria-expanded
  * aria-haspopup

### Testing

Testing for accessibility can be a somewhat painful process, if you try to manually find and fix all the issues. While it is good practice to go through a checklist and ensure all elements in the HTML5 client meet their accessibility requirements, this process can be very slow and time consuming. For this reason it is suggested to use an automated accessibility auditor first.

Both of these extensions provide the ability to scan the DOM and report on any accessibility issues based on levels which can be set, weather AA or AAA standards. For the purposes of the HTML5 client we follow the AA guidelines. Any reported errors also come with a listing of potential fixes.

***Note:***
***Once these extensions are installed to the browser they must be run from inside the console.***

# Coding Practices

When making a new component there is a certain structure to implement and existing components to utilize to make your life easier.

## Buttons


There is a standard button component we use in the client. It is located inside of <b>/imports/ui/shared/Button.jsx</b>. It should be used for every button.

## Font Size


Inside of <b>/client/stylesheets</b> there is a stylesheet <b>fontSizing.css</b>.

It will contain style classes such as extraSmallFont, smallFont, mediumFont, etc. Every piece of html with text to display to the client should be assigned one of these classes. This will allow text to scale responsively and still maintain relative size. You can set the class of an element to one of these classes, and have everything inside the container element inherit the font size rather than assign it to each individual child to save some work.

## Localization


The HTML5 client supports localizations by using the React-Intl  which allows the HTML5 client to have fully localized messages which are uploaded to Transifex for translating. As a result of this we have added the ability within the HTML5 client to switch the language of the application.

The main language file is `en.json`. When there is a new field to localize, we update `en.json`, and then the new field string becomes available for crowdsourced translation on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com)

When declaring formatted messages we use  defineMessages and  injectIntl in place of FormattedMessage.

~~~
Import { injectIntl } from ‘react-intl’;          //pass’s messages as prop to the component
import { defineMessages } from 'react-intl';      //import so we can group together all messages inside a component.

const intlMessages = defineMessages({             //all messages can be defined in intlMessages
  title: {
	id: 'app.about.title', 	                        //id corresponds to the id in the locale file
	description: 'About title label in Settings menu', //gives developers additional context about the element/item
  },
});
~~~

We omit the default message prop because it is the same as the string located in the locale file. By doing this we keep context of what the id’s mean while eliminating duplication.  Once the messages are defined we then add the following to use the `injectIntl`:

~~~
export default injectIntl(ComponentName);
~~~

From this point we can use the messages directly as they are passed down as props.

~~~
const { intl } = this.props;     //defined messages get passed as props

<Button
    role="button"
    label={intl.formatMessage(intlMessages.title)}   	  //gets rendered to the screen
    aria-label={intl.formatMessage(intlMessages.title)}    //voiced by screen reader
/>
~~~

If the browser is requesting a locale file that does not contain all the translations, all the available strings will be merged with the locale file set as the default. In this case all messages will be displayed but may have a mixture of languages.

If message id’s are missing from the locale file set as the default, and the browser requests the default or another locale containing a portion of the translated strings; there is potential for the missing id’s to not render a message and in this care default to the id of the message. To ensure this does not occur we make sure that the locale specified as the default always contains 100% of the used messages.

## Server Calls


To make a call to the server from the client, you should refer to the <b>callServer</b> function in <b>/imports/ui/services/api/index.js</b>.

Always use this in favor of <b>Meteor.call</b>. The <b>callServer</b> function should operate the same way in that you pass the name of the method to call as a string, and then the arguments just like normal.

[Meteor.call()](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteor_call)

</pre>

Taken from [Meteor Structure](http://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#example-app-structure)

Inside imports is where we store all units of functionality for the HTML5 client.

Inside API is where we store the collection data that we use, sort of like a model.

Inside UI is where we store what would be the view for the models.


## API


Located under <b>/imports/api</b>

Each sub-directory here will either be a data collection, or some service we use in the client.

The name of the subdirectory should be in lower-case representing the name of the Mongo collection, or following typical programming collection it will be PascalCased representing a class name.

Differing from the Meteor Structure is that for security purposes we want the majority of our functionality in the <b>/server</b> directory, which keeps it from loading on the clients.

The main export or class for the API component should be in <b>index.js</b>, which allows for easy importing. So to import the Polling collection for example, we can use the following code `import Polls from 'imports/api/polls/'`.

Since it is <b>index.js</b> we don’t have to specify that file since it is default.

Naming files this way can conflict with certain conventions where the file name is named after the main class inside it. To go about this we simply have a default export for the collections, and in the case of a collection we export the new instance.

Inside the <b>/server</b> directory of every API component we have a named file named publications.js. This is where we put the Meteor publish callback for the collection.

We now have 2 more sub-directories inside the <b>/server</b> directory-- methods and modifiers.

### /methods

Inside <b>/methods</b> we have one file per method. These methods are where we declare the Meteor.Methods for the collection-- which are Meteor server methods that can be invoked from the Meteor client. We have one file per method, and they are named in camelCase. They shouldn’t need an export because of how they are registered in Meteor. They will however have to be imported on the server (at startup) to execute the code.

### /modifiers

Inside <b>/modifiers</b> we have one file per method. These functions that go in here include the functions that modify the <b>collection/data/class</b>, from the server side. We have one file per method, and they are named in camelCase. There should be one export per file. And these will be imported wherever needed. These are almost all functions that will be called from Redis message listeners.

### eventHandlers.js

Inside `imports/api/<collection>/server/` we have a file called `eventHandlers.js`. This file will contain all the event handlers for the collection.

/ui
---

Inside /ui we will have sub-directories for

-   components

-   services

-   stylesheets

### /services

will have <b>/api/index.js</b>. Which is where we will store client-side-wide services and helpers. The functions and data in here will all be exported on the last line of the file in one export statement. This allows someone to just look at the last line of the file and easily see what the file exports.

### /components

Inside this directory each sub-directory will represent a React Component. The name of the sub-directory is what the name of the component is. They are all lowercase, with dashes (-) between words. The standard file are

-   component.jsx

-   container.jsx

-   service.js

-   styles.scss

Example

-&gt; /whiteboard

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; component.jsx

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; service.js

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; container.js

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; /slide/component.jsx

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; /cursor/component.jsx

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; /shape-factory/component.jsx

&emsp; &emsp;-&gt; /shapes

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;-&gt; /ellipse/component.jsx

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;-&gt; /triangle/component.jsx

&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;-&gt; ... &lt;the rest of the shape components&gt;

#### Component

All components will be React ES6 style classes (not React Classes). A component should only need to have one export and it should be the default export. Refer to the official React documentation on how to structure a component class. The component file will be named <b>component.jsx</b>.

#### Container

[createContainer()](http://guide.meteor.com/react.html#using-createContainer)

A container is a React ES6 class that will pass data to the component. The container will also be in control of whether or not the component should render. A container should retrieve data from the service and pass it into the container class.

The container file will be named <b>container.jsx</b>. The file should have only one export and should be the default export. The export should be the result of the `createContainer()` function.

#### Service

The service file should be named <b>service.js</b>.

The file can export as many function, objects, or other pieces of data as it needs. The service can interface with other collections as well. There should only be one export statement in the file. The last line of the file should export all the functions and pieces of data in an object. Restrain from wrapping everything inside a function and exporting the function wrapper.

#### Styles.scss

All styles should be written in SASS when possible.

### /private/config

All configuration files are located in **/private/config**. The file used depends on how you are running the client. In development mode (see `npm start` above) the configuration from `settings-development.json` is picked up. When running the packaged `bbb-html5` service or when passing NODE_ENV=production, the file `settings-production.json` is utilized. If you make any changes to the json configuration you will need to restart the html5 client.

During Meteor.startup() the configuration file is loaded and can be accessed through the Meteor.settings.public object.


# Client Logger

To assist with monitoring and debugging, the HTML5 client can send its logs to the BigBlueButton server via the `logger` function.  Here's an example of its use:

~~~  
import logger from '/imports/startup/client/logger'; 

logger.warn('Hi on warn') 
~~~ 

The client logger accepts three targets for the logs: `console`, `server` and `external`.


Name | Default Value |Accepted Values| Description 
 --- | --- | ---| ---
target | "console" | "console", "external", "server" | Where the logs will be sent to.
level | "info"  | "debug", "info", "warn", "error" | The lowest log level that will be sent. Any log level higher than this will also be sent to the target. 
url | - | - | The end point where logs will be sent to when the target is set to "external".
method | - | "POST", "PUT" | HTTP method being used when using the target "external".

There are default values in the HTML5 configuration file `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings-production.json` (`bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5/private/config/settings-development.json` if you are running the client from source code 

~~~
    "clientLog": {
      "server": { "enabled": true, "level": "info" },
      "console": { "enabled": false, "level": "debug" },
      "external": { "enabled": false, "level": "info", "url": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/html5Log", "method": "POST" }
    }
~~~

Notice that the `external` option is disabled by default - you can enable it on your own server after a few configuration changes.

When setting the output to `external`, the BigBlueButton client will POST the log events to the URL endpoint provided by `url`. To create an associated endpoint on the BigBlueButton server for the POST request, create a file `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client-log.nginx` with the following contents:

~~~
location /html5Log {
	access_log /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log postdata;
	echo_read_request_body;
}
~~~

Then create a file in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/client-log.conf` with the following contents:

~~~
log_format postdata '$remote_addr [$time_iso8601] $request_body';
~~~

Next, install the full version of nginx.

~~~
sudo apt-get install nginx-full
~~~

You may also need to create the external output file and give it the appropriate permissions and ownership:

~~~
sudo touch /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log
sudo chown www-data:adm /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log
sudo chmod 640 /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log
~~~

Restart BigBlueButton with `sudo bbb-conf --restart` and launch the BigBlueButton HTML5 client in a new session.  You should the logs appearing in `/var/log/nginx/html5-client.log` as follows

~~~
99.239.102.0 [2018-09-09T14:59:10+00:00] [{\x22name: .. }]
~~~

You can follow the logs on the server with the command

~~~
tail -f html5-client.log | sed -u -e 's/\\x22/"/g' -e 's/\\x5C/ /g'
~~~

# (DEMO) HTML5 API via iframe

## Overview

This document covers an API application of the BigBlueButton HTML5 Client.

This API is created to test the inner functionalities of HTML5 client from outside of it. Now only toggling the recording functionality on/off is implemented. 

The view of this API consists of the HTML5 client, trigger buttons and output screen. HTML5 client is embeded in I-frame element.

Clients can toggle the recording status on/off in I-frame using the button outside I-frame. If a client clicks on the button, the button and the output screen's content are changed based on the recording status of HTML5 Client.

## Functions

### Start / Stop Recording

Whenever the trigger button is clicked on, the recording status of HTML5 client is changing from not-recording to recording or recording to not-recording.

Based on the recording status of the embeded HTML5 client, the trigger button and output screen's inner content is changing.
