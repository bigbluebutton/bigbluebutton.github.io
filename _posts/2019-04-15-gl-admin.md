# Creating Accounts

The following examples assume you have Greenlight installed in the `~/greenlight` directory.  Before running the commands, change into the `~/greenlight` directory.

```bash
$ cd ~/greenlight
```

## Creating a User Account

To create an User account with specified values, in the Greenlight directory, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake user:create["name","email","password","user"]
```

Once the command has finished it will print the account’s email and password.

## Creating an Administrator Account

To create an Administrator account with the default values, in the Greenlight directory, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake admin:create
```

If you would like to configure the name, email, or password of the Administrator account, replace the previous command with this: 

```bash
$ docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake user:create["name","email","password","admin"]
```

Once the command has finished it will print the account’s email and password.
