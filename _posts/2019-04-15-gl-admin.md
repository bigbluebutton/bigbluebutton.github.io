# Administrator Panel

Greenlight has an administrator account that gives you the ability to manage users on the server.

## Creating an Administrator Account

The following examples assume you have Greenlight installed in the `~/greenlight` directory.  Before running the commands, change into the `~/greenlight` directory.

```bash
cd ~/greenlight
```

To create an Administrator account with the default values, in the Greenlight directory, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake admin:create
```

If you would like to configure the name, email, or password of the Administrator account, replace the previous command with this: 

```bash
docker exec greenlight-v2 bundle exec rake admin:create["name","email","password"]
```

**Note:** All of the above arguments are optional and if you don’t specify an argument it will be replaced with a default value.

Once the command has finished it will print the account’s email and password.

### Promoting Accounts

To promote an account from a User to an Administrator, select Promote to Admin from the Account Dropdown.

If `ALLOW_MAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` is set to `true` in the `.env` file, then the user will receive an email informing them that they have been promoted.

### Demoting Accounts

To demote an account from an Administrator to a User, select Demote to User from the Account Dropdown.

If `ALLOW_MAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` is set to `true` in the `.env` file, then the user will receive an email informing them that they have been demoted.

### Deleting Accounts

To delete an account, select Delete from the Account Dropdown. 

While this removes the account from Greenlight the user will still be able to sign up to Greenlight using the same email in the future.

### Banning Accounts

To ban an account, select Ban User from the account dropdown.

This will remove the account from Greenlight and will also prevent the user from signing up using the same email to Greenlight in the future.

From the edit user view, Administrators are able to edit the name, email, default language, and profile picture for the given account.

### Require Authentication to Join

By default, users that are not signed in can join any Room that has been started by the Room Owner if they are given the invitation link. This can be disabled, meaning that only users that are signed in will be allowed to join a Room.

### Number of Rooms per User

By default, users are allowed to create and manage as many rooms as they like. Using this setting, an Administrator can limit the number of rooms that the user can create. If the user is already above the limit and the setting is changed, the user will not be able to start any sessions for the rooms that are above the limit.

To allow the users to create as many rooms as they would like, select the option furthest to the right (15+).
